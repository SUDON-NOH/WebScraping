       "['Bladder cancers are biologically and clinically heterogeneous. Recent large-scale transcriptomic profiling studies focusing on life-threatening muscle-invasive cases have demonstrated a small number of molecularly distinct clusters that largely explain their heterogeneity. Similar to breast cancer, these clusters reflect intrinsic urothelial cell-type differentiation programs, including those with luminal and basal cell characteristics. Also like breast cancer, each cell-based subtype demonstrates a distinct profile with regard to its prognosis and its expression of therapeutic targets. Indeed, a number of studies suggest subtype-specific differential responses to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to therapies that inhibit a number of targets, including growth factors (EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR) and immune checkpoint (PD1, PDL1) inhibitors. Despite burgeoning evidence for important clinical implications, subtyping has yet to enter into routine clinical practice. Here we review the conceptual basis for intrinsic cell subtyping in muscle-invasive bladder cancer and discuss evidence behind proposed clinical uses for subtyping as a prognostic or predictive test. In deliberating barriers to clinical implementation, we review pitfalls associated with transcriptomic profiling and illustrate a simple immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based subtyping algorithm that may serve as a faster, less expensive alternative. Envisioned as a research tool that can easily be translated into routine pathology workflow, IHC-based profiling has the potential to more rapidly establish the utility (or lack thereof) of cell type profiling in clinical practice.

       " 'Anti-PD1 therapy has become an immunotherapeutic backbone for treating many cancer types. While many studies have aimed to characterize the immune response to anti-PD1 therapy in the tumor and in the peripheral blood, relatively less is known about the changes in the tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). TDLNs are primary sites of tumor antigen exposure that are critical to both regulation and cross-priming of the antitumor immune response. We employed multi-panel mass cytometry to obtain a high-parameter proteomic (39 total unique markers) immune profile of the TDLN in a well-studied PD1-responsive immunocompetent mouse model. Based on combined hierarchal gating and unsupervised clustering analyses, we found that anti-PD1 therapy enhances remodeling of both B and T cell compartments toward memory phenotypes. Functionally, expression of checkpoint markers was increased in conjunction with production of IFNγ, TNFα, or IL2 in key cell types, including B and T cell subtypes and rarer subsets such as Tregs and NKT cells. A deeper profiling of the immunologic changes that occur in the TDLN milieu during effective anti-PD1 therapy may lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers for monitoring response and provide key insights toward developing combination immunotherapeutic strategies.',\n",
       " 'Osteosarcoma is a serious malignancy in pediatric patients, which comprises 2.4% of fatal cancer in children and achieves 20% of all primary bone cancers. In the present study, we employed three human osteosarcoma cell lines MG‑63, HOS and U2OS for susceptibility to cytolytic activity of freshly isolated healthy donor NK cells. Cells were lysed by NK cells in a dose dependent manner. MG‑63 cells exhibited less susceptibility to NK cells than HOS and U2OS cells at all cell ratios. The specific mechanism underlying the effects of NK cells on osteosarcoma cells was determined by antibody blockage experiments. The results revealed that granzyme\\xa0B was the key factor in the NK cell‑induced cytotoxicity of human osteosarcoma cells. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the expression of PD‑L1 in MG‑63, HOS and U2OS cells. The relative expression of the PD‑L1 gene and protein in MG‑63 cell was greater than HOS and U2OS cells. The specific lysis of human osteosarcoma cells induced by NK cells was enhanced when PD‑L1/PD‑1 was blocked by the PD‑L1 antibody. The present study proposed that the PD‑L1/PD‑1 axis serves an important role in NK cell‑induced cytotoxicity in osteosarcoma via granzyme B secretion. Our findings may contribute to the development of precise treatments for osteosarcoma based on the expression profile of PD‑L1 in patients with this disease.',\n",

We enrolled 56 virally infected (VI) patients (pts): 13 HIV+ on suppressive cART (HIV-RNA < 40cp/ml), 13 HCV+ naive to DAA (direct-acting antiviral) anti-HCV agents; 30 HCV+/HIV+ on suppressive cART and naive to anti-HCV. 13 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. For Vα7.2+CD161++ and Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ T cells we assessed: activation (CD69), exhaustion (PD1/CD39), and cytolytic activity (granzymeB/perforin). Following PMA/ionomycin and Escherichia coli stimulation we measured intracellular IL17/TNFα/IFNγ. Markers of microbial translocation (Plasma LPS, 16S rDNA, EndoCAb and I-FABP) were quantified. In 5 patients per group we assessed stool microbiota composition by 16S targeted metagenomics sequencing (alpha/beta diversity, relative abundance). Compared to controls, virally infected pts displayed significantly lower circulating Vα7.2+CD161++CD8+ MAIT cells (p = 0.001), yet expressed higher perforin (p = 0.004) and granzyme B (p = 0.002) on CD8+ MAIT cells. Upon E. coli stimulation, the residual MAIT cells are less functional particularly those from HIV+/HCV+ patients. Conversely, in virally infected pts, Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ cells were comparable in frequency, highly activated/exhausted (CD69+: p = 0.002; PD-1+: p = 0.030) and with cytolytic potential (perforin+: p < 0.0001), yet were poorly responsive to ex vivo stimulation. A profound gut dysbiosis characterized virally infected pts, especially HCV+/HIV+ co-infected patients, delineating a Firmicutes-poor/Bacteroidetes-rich microbiota, with significant associations with MAIT cell frequency/function. Irrespective of mono/dual infection, HIV+ and HCV+ patients display depleted, yet activated/cytolytic MAIT cells with reduced ex vivo function, suggesting an impoverished pool, possibly due to continuous bacterial challenge. The MAIT cell ability to respond to bacterial stimulation correlates with the presence of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, possibly suggesting an association between gut dysbiosis and MAIT cell function and posing viral-mediated dysbiosis as a potential key player in the hampered anti-bacterial MAIT ability.',\n",
       " 'Immunotherapy delivered a new therapeutic option to the oncologist: Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab (anti-PD1), and Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) increase overall survival and show a better safety profile compared to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma, lung, renal cancer among others. But all that glitters is not gold and there is an increasing number of reports of adverse effects while using immune-checkpoint inhibitors. While chemotherapy could weaken the immune system, this novel immunotherapy could hyper-activate it, resulting in a unique and distinct spectrum of adverse events, called immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). IRAEs, ranging from mild to potentially life-threatening events, can involve many systems, and their management is radically different from that of cytotoxic drugs: immunosuppressive treatments, such as corticoids, infliximab or mycophenolate mofetil, usually result in complete reversibility, but failing to do so can lead to severe toxicity or even death. Patient selection is an indirect way to reduce adverse events minimizing the number of subjects exposed to this drugs: unfortunately PDL-1, the actual predictive biomarker, would not allow clinicians select or exclude patients for treatment with checkpoint inhibitors.',\n",
       " 'Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation can render lymphocyte repertoires qualitatively and quantitatively defective. Thus, heavily treated patients are often poor candidates for the manufacture of autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell products. In the United States and Europe, children with high-risk neuroblastoma undergo apheresis early in the course of treatment to collect peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for cryopreservation in preparation for high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue. Here, we investigate whether these cryopreserved chemotherapy and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSCs can serve as starting material for CAR-T cell manufacturing. We evaluated T cell precursor subsets in cryopreserved PBSC units from 8 patients with neuroblastoma using fluorescent activated cell sorting-based analysis. Every cryopreserved unit collected early in treatment contained both CD4 and CD8 precursors with significant numbers of naïve and central memory precursors. Significant numbers of Ki67+/PD1+ T cells were detected, presumably the result of chemotherapy-induced lymphopenia and subsequent homeostatic proliferation. Cryopreserved PBSC units containing 56 to 112\\u202f×\\u202f106 T cells were amenable to immunomagnetic selection, CD3\\u202f×\\u202f28 bead activation, lentiviral transduction, and cytokine-driven expansion, provided that CD14 monocytes were depleted before the initiation of cultures. Second- and third-generation CD171 CAR+ CD4 and CD8 effector cells derived from cryopreserved units displayed antineuroblastoma lytic potency and cytokine secretion comparable to those derived from a healthy donor and mediated in vivo antitumor regression in NSG mice. We conclude that cryopreserved PBSCs procured via standard methods during early treatment can serve as an alternative starting source for CAR-T cell manufacturing, extending the options for heavily treated patients.',\n",
       " 'Mutational heterogeneity could explain different metastatic patterns among IIIA-N2 lung cancer and influence prognosis. The identification of subclonal mutations using deep sequencing to evaluate the degree of molecular heterogeneity may improve IIIA-N2 classification. The aim of this prospective study was to assess mutational and immunohistochemical characteristics in primary tumours and involved lymph nodes (LN) in operated patients. Four patients operated for primary lung carcinoma and unisite N2 mediastinal involvement were consecutively selected. Samples (tumour and paired LN) were analysed for PD1, PD-L1 and CD8 immunostaining. Somatic mutation testing was performed by deep targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), with the AmpliSeq™ Colon and Lung Cancer Panel (LifeTechnology). A total of 9 primary lung cancer samples and 10 LN stations were analysed. For each cancer, we found 2 mutations, with allelic ratios from 3% to 72%. Mutational patterns were heterogeneous for 2 primary tumours. In 3 cases, mutations observed in the primary tumour were not found in LN metastases (ALK, FGFR3, MET). Inversely, in 1 case, a KRAS mutation was found in LN but not in the primary tumour. All primary tumours were found PD-L1 positive while CD8+ T cells infiltrate varied. In the different examined LN samples, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ and PD1+ T cells infiltrate were not similar to the primary tumour. This preliminary prospective study shows the diversity of intra-tumour and LN mutations using routinely-used targeted NGS, concerning both mutated gene and allelic ratio. Further studies are needed to evaluate its prognostic impact.',\n",

       " 'It is obvious that tumor cells have developed a number of strategies to escape immune surveillance including an altered expression of various immune checkpoints, such as the programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 results in an activation of self-tolerance pathways in both immune cells as well as tumor cells. Thus, these molecules represent excellent targets for T cell-based immunotherapies. However, the efficacy of therapies using checkpoint inhibitors is variable and only a limited number of patients receive a long-term response, while others develop resistances. Therefore, a better insight into the constitutive expression levels and their control as well as the predictive and prognostic value of PD-1/PD-L1, which are controversially discussed due to the methodological assessment, the dynamic and time-related variable expression of these molecules, is urgently required. In this review, the current knowledge of the PD-L1 and PD-1 genes, their expression in immune and tumor cells, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their regulation and their association with clinical parameters and therapy responses are summarized.',\n",

       " 'Checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD1/PD-L1 have demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in a subset of patients partly through reinvigoration of CD8 T cells. However, their impact on myeloid cells remains largely unknown. Here, we report that anti-PD-L1 treatment favorably impacts the phenotype and function of tumor macrophages by polarizing the macrophage compartment toward a more proinflammatory phenotype. This phenotype was characterized by a decrease in Arginase-I (ARG1) expression and an increase in iNOS, MHCII, and CD40 expression. Whole-transcriptome profiling further confirmed extensive polarization of both tumor monocytes and macrophages from a suppressive to a proinflammatory, immunostimulatory phenotype. This polarization was driven mainly through IFNγ and was associated with enhanced T-cell activity. Transfer of monocytes into anti-PD-L1-treated tumor-bearing mice led to macrophage differentiation into a more proinflammatory phenotype, with an increase in CD8 T cells expressing granzyme-B and an increase in the CD8/Treg ratio compared with control-treated mice. Although in responsive tumor models, anti-PD-L1 treatment remodeled the macrophage compartment with beneficial effects on T cells, both macrophage reprogramming and depletion were needed to maximize anti-PD-L1 responses in a tumor immune contexture with high macrophage burden. Our results demonstrate that anti-PD-L1 treatment can favorably remodel the macrophage compartment in responsive tumor models toward a more proinflammatory phenotype, mainly through increased IFNγ levels. They also suggest that directly targeting these cells with reprogramming and depleting agents may further augment the breadth and depth of response to anti-PD-L1 treatment in less responsive or more macrophage-dense tumor microenvironments. SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates that increased IFNγ signaling following anti-PD-L1 treatment can remodel the macrophage compartment to enhance T-cell responses.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/7/1493/F1.large.jpg.',\n",

Treatment with anti-PD1 therapy decreases foetal-maternal tolerance and increases the risk of pregnancy loss in animal studies and is considered category D by the Food and Drug Administration. We describe a unique case of conception and pregnancy, with successful maternal and foetal outcomes, in a patient with metastatic melanoma who had received combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 therapy. A 32-year-old G0P0 lady, with a 10-year history of infertility of unclear cause, was found to be 7 weeks pregnant after 14 months of nivolumab maintenance therapy, having previously received combination ipilimumab and nivolumab. Nivolumab was ceased upon discovery of pregnancy in the first trimester. The patient had an uneventful pregnancy, followed by spontaneously premature labour, and delivered by caesarean section at 33 weeks' gestation. The foetus had moderate intrauterine growth restriction, as well as congenital hypothyroidism, which possibly constitutes the first documented case of foetal immune-related adverse event from maternal anti-PD1 exposure. No adverse events were noted in the mother. At 6 months of follow-up postpartum, the mother had a sustained complete response to treatment, and the baby had appropriate weight gain with normal developmental milestones. We summarize and discuss the available literature of immune checkpoint inhibitor exposure in pregnancy, which consists of a total of three case reports.\",\n",
       " 'Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising and effective treatment for cancer. The frequently used immunotherapy agents are immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies specific to PD1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4. However, these drugs are highly expensive, and most people in the world cannot access the treatment. The development of recombinant protein production platforms that are cost-effective, scalable, and safe is needed. Plant platforms are attractive because of their low production cost, speed, scalability, lack of human and animal pathogens, and post-translational modifications that enable them to produce effective monoclonal antibodies. In this study, an anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plant-produced anti-PD1 mAb was compared to the commercial nivolumab produced in CHO cells. Our results showed that both antibodies have similar protein structures, and the N-glycans on the plant-produced antibody lacks plant-specific structures. The PD1 binding affinity of the plant-produced and commercial nivolumab, determined by two different techniques, that is, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), are also comparable. Plant-produced nivolumab binds to human PD1 protein with high affinity and specificity, blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, and enhances T cell function, comparable to commercial nivolumab. These results confirmed that plant-produced anti-PD1 antibody has the potential to be effective agent for cancer immunotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Inflammation involving migration of immune cells across the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB), activation of resident innate microglia and production of inflammatory humoral mediators such as cytokines and chemokines play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Cell-cell signaling involved in the process also includes checkpoint interaction between programmed death receptor (PD1) and programmed death ligands, PDL1 and PDL2. Based on our previous studies showing reduced MCAO infarct volumes in PDL2 deficient mice, we evaluated the ability of anti-PDL2 mAb to treat MCAO in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We found that anti-PDL2 neutralizing antibody treatment of MCAO significantly reduced infarct volumes in male mice but had no protective effects in female mice even at a 5-fold increased dose of anti-PDL2 mAb. The protection in male mice was likely mediated by reduced percentages in the spleen of PDL2+CD19+ B cells, PDL1+CD4+ T cells and CD86+CD11b+ macrophages in concert with reduced expression of PDL1 and TNFα and continued expression of CD206, in the injured ipsilateral brain hemisphere. The lack of a therapeutic benefit of anti-PDL2 on stroke-induced infarct volumes in female mice was reflected by no detectable reduction in expressed PDL2 or PDL1 and an increased frequency of Th1 and Th17 pro-inflammatory T cell subsets in the spleen, an effect not seen in PDL2 mAb treated males. This result potentially limits the utility of anti-PDL2 mAb therapy in stroke to males but underscores the importance of meeting the STAIR requirements for development of new stroke therapies for both sexes.',\n",
       " 'Antibodies targeting PD1 receptor have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy against multiple types of solid cancers. However, relatively low complete response rates observed with anti-PD1 mAb monotherapy emphasizes the importance of testing new immunotherapeutic combinations. The production of extracellular adenosine in solid tumors was recently identified as a major immunosuppressive pathway, targeting this pathway would enhance the therapeutic activity of anti-PD1 mAbs. In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity and mechanism of action of caffeine and anti-PD1 mAb combination therapy against carcinogen- and cell line-induced tumors. Our results demonstrate that combination therapy enhanced the anti-tumor activity and prolonged overall survival period against 3-MCA-induced tumors. In addition, combination therapy showed a significant anti-tumor activity against B16F10 melanoma tumors. We found that combination therapy showed additive increase in infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes into the B16F10 melanoma tumors. On the other hand, combination therapy showed significant decrease in infiltration of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells. We further investigated whether the observed anti-tumor effect of caffeine and anti-PD1 mAb combination therapy is mediated through the release of cytokines. We found that caffeine and anti-PD1 mAb combination therapy significantly increased intra-tumoral TNF-α and IFN-γ levels. Our work suggests that administration of caffeine and anti-PD1 mAb harness the therapeutic potential of effector T cells in vivo possibly due to combined blockade of PD1 and adenosine-A2A receptor pathway. This study provides the scientific basis for testing combination regimens of caffeine and anti-PD1 mAbs for sustained tumor control in cancer patients.',\n",

Treatment outcome still cannot be faithfully predicted. The following study hypothesized that host genetics could be applied as predictive biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor response and immune-related adverse events. We conducted a study based on germinal polymorphisms from genes coding for proteins involved in immune regulation. Methods Germinal DNA was obtained from advanced cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. DNA was genotyped using a custom panel of 166 single nucleotide polymorphisms covering 86 preselected immunogenetic-related genes. Computational analysis using a GTEX portal was made to determine potential expression Quantitative Trait Loci in tissues. Results Ninety-four consecutive patients were included. Objective response rate (complete or partial response) was significantly correlated to tumor microenvironment-related SNPs concerning CCL2, NOS3, IL1RN, IL12B, CXCR3 and IL6R genes. Toxicity were linked to target-related gene SNPs including UNG, IFNW1, CTLA4, PD-L1 and IFNL4 genes. The Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72-0.9) for response and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.76-1.00) for toxicity. In silico functionality exploring pointed rs4845618 (IL6R), rs10964859 (IFNW1) and rs3087243 (CTLA4) as potentially impacting gene expression. Conclusion These results strongly support a role for distinct immunogenetic-related gene SNPs able to predict efficacy and safety of anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapies. The results highlight the existence of patient-specific, germinal biomarkers able predict response to checkpoint inhibitor efficacy and, possibly, to predict treatment-related adverse events.',\n",

The expression status of PD1/PD-L1 in BPDCN remains unknown. We evaluated PD1/PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry and RNAseq expression profiling in a cohort of BPDCN patients. The study group included 28 patients with a median age of 66.8 years (range, 22.8-86.7), 22 men and 6 women. PD-L1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 10/21 (47.6%) cases. PD-L1 expression had a median H-score of 157. The H-score was ≥60 in 7 patients. PD-L1 protein levels (H-score) were proportional to normalized PD-L1 mRNA transcript levels (CD274 mRNA). In addition, high-level PD-L1 expression correlated with higher numbers of PD1-positive cells within BPDCN tumors. There was no correlation between clinicopathologic characteristics and PD-L1 expression status. Similarly, there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients with PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative BPDCN (median 12 vs. 23 month, respectively; p = 0.743). In conclusion, PD-L1 expression by tumor cells is detectable in a sizeable subset of patients with BPDCN, suggesting that exploration of the effectiveness of therapeutic inhibition of the PD1/PD-L1 axis in patients with refractory or progressive BPDCN is warranted.',\n",

Researchers have conducted a large number of studies on the pathogenesis of GBM; however, these studies are not comprehensive. High-throughput sequence analysis allows for insights into the pathogenesis of GBM. In this study, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset to identify the function of RARRES1 enriched in GBM, especially in the WHO grade-IV cases. We discovered that RARRES1 is highly expressed in patients with mesenchymal subtype, unmethylated MGMT, IDH1 wild type, and non-G-CIMP, all of which are molecular characteristics of malignant GBM. Results of the immune microenvironment analysis showed that RARRES1 is strongly correlated with dendritic cells PD1, PDL2, TIM3, and CTLA4, which are the immune checkpoints in GBM. Furthermore, according to the overall survival and status analysis, a high expression of RARRES1 was found to be an unfavorable factor for prognosis. This indicates that RARRES1 may participate in the pathogenesis and immune-related processes in GBM, and may serve as a therapeutic target.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to determine the tumor mutational burden (TMB) and the expression of immunohistochemical (IHC) markers in NMCs that are generally used to identify patients that might benefit from checkpoint immunotherapy. Three cases in a 39-year-old male (case 1) and two 13-year-old females (cases 2, 3) were identified from departmental files, with confirmation by NUT IHC and 15q14 rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Normal-tumor paired whole exome sequencing (WES) was applied to determine TMB. IHC for DNA mismatch repair proteins, Programmed cell death ligand 1, programmed cell death 1 (PD1), and CD8 was also performed. WES yielded a TMB of 7.61 and 1.52 per Mbp in the primary and pulmonary metastasis in case 1, respectively, and a TMB of 1.04 per Mbp in the primary tumor of case 2. Programmed cell death ligand 1 tumor proportion score was 20%, 1%, and 0% and combined positive score was 25, 5, and 0 in cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively; PD1 stain counts were 25, 52, and 35 per high-power field and the PD1/CD8 ratio was 95%, 95%, and 99% in cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The CD8 count per high-power field was 15, 33, and 30 per high-power field in cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Mismatch repair IHCs showed retained staining. Although the number of cases is limited, this study is the first to investigate checkpoint immunotherapy markers in NMCs and the results demonstrate no clear biomarker association. However, the results suggest that, if checkpoint therapy is under consideration, a comprehensive workup utilizing WES and IHC is warranted.',\n",

This score achieved an overall accuracy of AUC = 0.77, 0.80 and 0.73 in the training cohort, validation cohort and on-anti-PD1 cohort, respectively. Patients with high immunoscores had significantly higher objective response rates (ORRs) than did those with low immunoscores (ORR: 53.8% vs 17.7%, P < 0.001 for entire pre-anti-PD1 cohort; 42.1% vs 15.1%, P = 0.022 for on-anti-PD1 cohort; 66.7% vs 16.7%, P = 0.038 for neoadjuvant anti-PD1 cohort).

       " 'Immunomodulatory antibodies blocking interactions of coinhibitory receptors to their ligands such as CTLA-4, PD1 and PD-L1 on immune cells have shown impressive therapeutic efficacy in clinical studies. The therapeutic effect of these antibodies is mainly mediated by reactivating antitumor T cell immune responses. Detailed analysis of anti-CTLA4 antibody therapy revealed that an optimal therapeutic efficacy also requires binding to Fc receptors for IgG, FcγR, mediating depletion of intratumoral regulatory T cells. Here, we investigated the role of Fc binding in anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy in the MC38 C57BL/6 and CT26 BALB/c colon adenocarcinoma tumor models. In the MC38 tumor model, all IgG subclasses anti-PD-L1 showed similar therapeutic efficacy when compared to each other in either wild-type mice or in mice deficient for all FcγR. In contrast, in the CT26 tumor model, anti-PD-L1 mIgG2a, the IgG subclass with the highest affinity for activating FcγR, showed stronger therapeutic efficacy than other IgG subclasses. This was associated with a reduction of a myeloid cell subset with high expression of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment. This subclass preference for mIgG2a was lost in C57BL/6 × BALB/c F1 mice, indicating that the genetic background of the host may determine the additional clinical benefit of the high affinity antibody subclasses. Based on these data, we conclude that FcγR are not crucial for anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy but might play a role in some tumor models.',\n",

       " 'Patients with colon cancer remain largely refractory to current immunotherapeutic strategies. This is, in part, due to the overexpression of the immune checkpoint protein indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO). IDO is an important enzyme contributing to tumor-mediated immunosuppression and also correlates with poor prognosis in colon cancer patients. The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of attenuated Salmonella typhimurium delivering an shRNA plasmid targeting IDO (shIDO-ST) in two mouse models of colorectal cancer. In vitro, the CT26 and MC38 murine colon cancer cell lines were shown to upregulate IDO expression following stimulation with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Transfection of both cell lines with shIDO plasmid reduced IDO protein expression and function. In vivo, shIDO-ST treatment significantly delayed CT26 and MC38 tumor progression compared to mice treated with scrambled shRNA control (shScr-ST) or the clinically tested IDO inhibitor epacadostat. Increased tumor infiltration of neutrophils was found to be the primary immune cell population associated with shIDO-ST treatment, suggesting robust activation of innate immunity. Although increased tumor expression of IDO is associated with resistance to antibody therapy against programed cell death-1 (anti-PD1), co-administration of anti-PD1 with shIDO-ST did not provide additional tumor growth control in either model of colorectal cancer. Altogether, we demonstrate that treatment with shIDO-ST markedly delays tumor growth in two immunocompetent colorectal mouse models and this appears to be a superior therapeutic strategy compared to epacadostat or blocking anti-PD1 antibody therapy in colon cancer.',\n",

Linrodostat mesylate (BMS-986205) - a selective, potent, oral IDO1 inhibitor - combined with nivolumab has demonstrated safety and preliminary evidence of clinical activity in metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Here, we discuss the rationale and trial design of the ENERGIZE, a Phase III trial investigating the efficacy of NAC in combination with nivolumab with or without linrodostat followed by postsurgery nivolumab or nivolumab with linrodostat in cisplatin-eligible patients with MIBC.

       " 'Autologous stem cell transplantation is the standard salvage strategy for young and fit patients with Hodgkin lymphoma failing induction therapy, and is effective in nearly 50% of cases. The quality of response at transplantation is the most relevant prognostic aspect, as patients in complete response can obtain better outcomes. Therefore, first-line salvage treatments applied before transplantation need to produce high quality responses without excessive myelotoxicity and without affecting peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation. In this sense, the incorporation of new agents active in Hodgkin lymphoma, such as brentuximab vedotin and anti-programmed\\xa0death 1 antibodies, in conventional regimens, may help to enhance complete remission rates. Working on conditioning regimen and applying a post-autologous consolidation treatment (for example with brentuximab vedotin) are two ways for improving transplant outcomes, particularly in patients displaying high-risk features for early relapse or progression. Allogeneic transplantation maintains its curative potential also in the era of new drugs, although its most correct timing and the most suitable sequence of post-autologous\\xa0salvage treatments still remain to be determined.',\n",
       " 'Double somatic mismatch-repair-gene mutation/alteration is a recently recognized molecular mechanism that underlies microsatellite instability-high in some colorectal carcinomas. It remains to be determined whether and how microsatellite instability-high tumors with this molecular defect differ from their counterparts caused by other mechanisms, specifically, Lynch syndrome-associated and MLH1-promoter hypermethylated. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and pathological characteristics of a series of 15 double somatic mutation/alteration-associated microsatellite instability-high colorectal carcinomas identified from our genetics service and 68 such cases reported in the literature. We observed that these cases presented at an age similar to MLH1-promoter hypermethylated (n\\u2009=\\u200920) and microsatellite-stable (n\\u2009=\\u200939) cases but older than Lynch syndrome-associated cases (n\\u2009=\\u200920, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). While these tumors simulated other microsatellite instability-high tumors in their prevalent right-sided location, they appeared to differ in TNM stages at presentation (73% stage III/IV versus 25% stage III/IV in other microsatellite instability-high tumors, p\\u2009=\\u20090.04). Histologically, 40% of them had a dominant solid growth pattern. Inter-tumoral heterogeneity was a striking feature, spanning the spectrum from medullary type (with a tumor-infiltrating-lymphocyte/high-power-field count as high as 59) to conventional-type with only few tumor-infiltrating-lymphocytes (1/high-power-filed). As a group, these tumors seemed less likely to show robustly high lymphocytic infiltration than other microsatellite instability-high tumors (only 20% had ≥10 tumor-infiltrating-lymphocytes/high-power-filed, whereas this rate in Lynch syndrome-associated and MLH1-promoter hypermethylated tumors was 60% and 75%, respectively). Three double somatic mutation/alteration-associated tumors were treated with a PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. While all three had an elevated tumor-mutation-burden (>47 mut/megabase), only one had tumor-infiltrating-lymphocytes >10/high-power-field, yet all three exhibited measurable response. In summary, microsatellite instability-high colorectal carcinomas caused by double somatic mismatch-repair-gene mutation/alteration may have varied clinical and pathological characteristics, and some may have relatively low tumor-infiltrating-lymphocytes; response to immune checkpoint inhibitors can be achieved in this group even when the lymphocytic infiltration is not abundant.',\n",
       " 'Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a viral encephalitis disease caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Uncontrolled inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS) are a hallmark of severe JE. Although the CCR2-CCL2 axis is important for monocytes trafficking during JEV infection, little is known about its role in CNS trafficking of CD8+ T cells. Here, we characterized a mouse model of JEV infection, induced via intravenous injection (i.v.) and delineated the chemokines and infiltrating peripheral immune cells in the brains of infected mice. The CNS expression of chemokines, Ccl2, Ccl3, and Ccl5, and their receptors, Ccr2 or Ccr5, was significantly up-regulated after JEV infection and was associated with the degree of JE pathogenesis. Moreover, JEV infection resulted in the migration of a large number of CD8+ T cells into the CNS. In the brains of JEV-infected mice, infiltrating CD8+ T cells expressed CCR2 and CCR5 and were found to comprise mainly effector T cells (CD44+CD62L-). JEV infection dramatically enhanced the expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) on infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the brain, as compared to that on peripheral CD8+ T cells in the spleen. This effect was more pronounced on infiltrating CCR2+CD8+ T cells than on CCR2-CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, we identified a new subset of CD8+ T cells (PD1+CCR2+CD8+ T cells) present in the CNS of mice during acute JEV infection. These CD8+ T cells might play a role in JE pathogenesis.',\n",
       " 'TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on lymphocytes that was recently propelled under the spotlight as a major emerging target in cancer immunotherapy. TIGIT interacts with CD155 expressed on antigen-presenting cells or tumour cells to down-regulate T cell and NK cell functions. TIGIT has emerged as a key inhibitor of anti-tumour responses that can hinder multiple steps of the cancer immunity cycle. Preclinical studies indicated that TIGIT blockade may protect against various solid and haematological cancers. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block the inhibitory activity of human TIGIT have been developed. Clinical trials are ongoing, investigating TIGIT blockade as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs for the treatment of patients with advanced solid malignancies.

       " 'The formation, development and dissolution of germinal centers is a major part of immune system function. It is important to differentiate neoplastic processes from follicular hyperplasia and regressive follicular changes. Better understanding of germinal center development and dissolution also provides diagnostic clues to the underlying pathologic process. It is also important in identifying the immune basis of different pathologic entities as well as in immunotherapy decision making and follow up. In this study, we characterize the immunoarchitecture of lymphoid follicles with a focus on germinal center in one representative case, each of commonly encountered benign and malignant lymph node disorders, with morphologic and immunohistochemical alterations of germinal centers. The cases include reactive follicular hyperplasia (FH), florid follicular hyperplasia (FFH), follicular lymphoma (FL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), hyaline-vascular Castleman disease (HVCD), progressive transformation of germinal centers, nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma (LR-CHL), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated follicular dissolution and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with proliferation centers (PC).

We found that these entities show distinct immunoarchitectural patterns of germinal center formation, development and regression, particularly, the distribution of mantle zone B-cells, follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and FDC meshworks, confirming the influence of antigenic stimulation and status of immune system in these changes. This also confirms the interrelationship of underlying immunologic mechanisms in these disease processes.',\n",

Among available immune profiling techniques, multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) assays offer the unique advantage of preserving the architectural features of the tumor and revealing the spatial relationships between tumor cells and immune cells. A number of mIF and image analysis assays have been described for solid tumors but most are not sufficiently suitable in lymphoma, where the lack of clear tumor-stromal boundaries and high tumor density present significant challenges. Here we describe the development and optimization of a reliable workflow using Akoya Opal staining kits to label and analyze 6 markers per slide in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tissue sections. Five panels totaling 30 markers were developed to characterize infiltrating immune cells and relevant check-point proteins such as PD1, PD-L1, ICOS, SIRP-alpha and Lag3 on 70 DLBCL sections. Multiplexed sections were scanned using an Akoya multispectral scanner. An image analysis workflow using InForm and Matlab was developed to overcome challenges inherent to the DLBCL environment. Using the assays and workflows detailed here, we were able to quantify cell densities of subsets of infiltrating immune cells and observe their spatial patterns within the tumors. We highlight heterogeneous distribution of cytotoxic T cells across tumors with similar T cell density to underscores the importance of considering spatial context when studying the effects of immunological therapies in DLBCL.\",\n",

Limited research, however, has evaluated the impact of these therapies in a real-world setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among advanced melanoma patients treated with modern therapies within community oncology clinics. Adult patients with advanced melanoma who initiated treatment within the US Oncology Network between 1/1/14 and 12/31/16 were included. Data were sourced from electronic healthcare records. Patients were followed through 12/31/17. Descriptive analyses were performed to assess patient and treatment characteristics and Kaplan-Meier methods were used for time-to-event outcomes. In total, 484 patients met eligibility criteria (32.0% with brain metastasis, 12.6% with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2). In the first-line (1L) setting during the study period, 37.0% received anti-PD1 monotherapies, 26.4% ipilimumab monotherapy, 19.8% BRAF/MEK combination therapy, 6.4% BRAF or MEK monotherapy, 4.1% ipilimumab/nivolumab combination therapy and 6.2% other regimens. Differences in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were observed across treatment groups. For the overall study population, the median (95% confidence interval) estimates for overall survival, time to next treatment and progression-free survival were 20.7 (16.0, 26.8), 5.8 (5.3, 6.5), and 4.9 (4.2, 5.7) months, respectively. The results of this study provide real-world insight into advanced melanoma treatment trends and clinical outcomes, including high utilization of immunotherapies and BRAF/MEK combination therapy.

       " 'Radiotherapy can be synergistically combined with immunotherapy in mouse models, extending its efficacious effects outside of the irradiated field (abscopal effects). We previously reported that a regimen encompassing local radiotherapy in combination with anti-CD137 plus anti-PD-1 mAbs achieves potent abscopal effects against syngeneic transplanted murine tumors up to a certain tumor size. Knowing that TGFβ expression or activation increases in irradiated tissues, we tested whether TGFβ blockade may further enhance abscopal effects in conjunction with the anti-PD-1 plus anti-CD137 mAb combination. Indeed, TGFβ blockade with 1D11, a TGFβ-neutralizing mAb, markedly enhanced abscopal effects and overall treatment efficacy against subcutaneous tumors of either 4T1 breast cancer cells or large MC38 colorectal tumors. Increases in CD8 T cells infiltrating the nonirradiated lesion were documented upon combined treatment, which intensely expressed Granzyme-B as an indicator of cytotoxic effector capability. Interestingly, tumor tissue but not healthy tissue irradiation results in the presence of higher concentrations of TGFβ in the nonirradiated contralateral tumor that showed smad2/3 phosphorylation increases in infiltrating CD8 T cells. In conclusion, radiotherapy-induced TGFβ hampers abscopal efficacy even upon combination with a potent immunotherapy regimen. Therefore, TGFβ blockade in combination with radioimmunotherapy results in greater efficacy.',\n",

Our study assesses the utility of an immunohistochemical panel of 5 TFH markers (CD10, BCL6, PD-1, CXCL13, and ICOS) for identification of TFH phenotype in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS). Immunohistochemical for the 5 markers was performed on 22 cases of AITL and 29 cases of PTCL-NOS. Cases were reviewed for morphologic features characteristic of AITL. All AITL cases showed expression of ≥2 TFH markers. This panel resulted in reclassification of 41% PTCL-NOS cases to PTCL-TFH. Positive percent agreement for the TFH phenotype is 97% for PD1, 94% for ICOS, 44% for CD10 and CXCL13, and 29% for BCL6. Negative percent agreement for TFH phenotype is 100% for CD10, BCL6, and CXCL13, 82% for ICOS and 71% for PD1. AITL cases were more likely than PTCL-TFH cases to contain expanded CD21-positive follicular dendritic cell meshworks, clear cell cytology and polymorphous inflammatory background; however, there was a significant (P<0.005) Kruskal-Wallis trend in all morphologic variables between the 3 groups suggesting a continuum from PTCL-NOS to PTCL-TFH to AITL. The median number of morphologic features of AITL also correlated significantly with number of TFH markers positive (Spearman coefficient ρ=0.759). In summary, the stain panel chosen will have an impact on cases classified as PTCL-TFH. This entity may exist along a spectrum between PTCL-NOS and AITL.',\n",
       " 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have drastically changed the clinical care of cancer. Although cancer immunotherapy has shown promise in various types of malignancies, thus far, the proportion of patients who can benefit from ICIs is relatively small. Immune-related adverse events and high cost are unavoidable problems. Therefore, biomarkers defining patients that are most likely to benefit from ICIs are urgently needed. The expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a logical biomarker for the prediction of response to anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapies. However, its usefulness is currently debatable because of its varied definition, threshold, and spatial/temporal heterogeneity. Recently, it was reported that the tumor mutational burden, expression of neoantigens, mismatch repair status, and specific gene mutations may be markers for the success of treatment with ICIs. Moreover, it was suggested that the fecal microbiota prior to immunotherapy may play an important role in predicting the efficacy of ICIs. In this review, we focused on these potential biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy reported in recent clinical articles. Further studies are warranted to develop a predictive model using these biomarkers, with the aim of practicing precision medicine in cancer immunotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Two Pd(II) complexes based on tetradentate chelate ligands with either a 1,2,4-triazolyl (Pd1) or 1,2,3-triazolyl (Pd2) unit were synthesized, and their structure-property relationships were studied. Both Pd1 and Pd2 are rare bright deep blue Pd(II) phosphors with contrasting properties. Pd1 displays stimuli-responsive luminescence in response to UV irradiation, concentration, or temperature change, which is ascribed to the facile switching of monomer to excimer emission. In contrast, a similar stimuli-responsive luminescence was not observed for Pd2. Crystal structures and time-dependent density functional theory computational studies established that the excimer formation of Pd1 is caused by electronically favored intermolecular π-π interactions and less steric protection of the Pd core because of the position of its alkyl chains, compared to Pd2. In solution, the excimer emission of Pd1 shows a much greater sensitivity toward oxygen than the monomer emission with a very large Stern-Volmer constant ( Ksv) that is more than twice that of the monomer emission. Both Pd(II) complexes are found to be outstanding oxygen sensors in ethyl cellulose films with superior sensitivity ( Ksvapp = 0.228-0.346 Torr-1) over their Pt(II) equivalents ( Ksvapp = 0.00674-0.0110 Torr-1), owing to their long phosphorescence decay lifetimes. Furthermore, Pd1 shows an excellent photostability, compared to the Pt(II) analogue, making it one of the best and highly robust oxygen sensors based on cyclometalated metal complexes.',\n",

PD1 antibody-based immunotherapy, co-administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab, is one of the optimal immunotherapies, especially in advanced melanoma with high tumor mutation burden. Since this combined therapy leads to a high frequency of serious immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with advanced melanoma, biomarkers are needed to evaluate nivolumab efficacy to avoid serious irAEs caused by ipilimumab. This study analyzed baseline serum levels of CXCL5, CXCL10, and CCL22 in 46 cases of advanced cutaneous melanoma treated with nivolumab. Baseline serum levels of CXCL5 were significantly higher in responders than in non-responders. In contrast, there were no significant differences in baseline serum levels of CXCL10 and CCL22 between responders and non-responders. These results suggest that baseline serum levels of CXCL5 may be useful as a biomarker for identifying patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma most likely to benefit from anti-melanoma immunotherapy.',\n",

We have investigated the baseline follicular and GC composition in nonhuman primates (NHPs) with respect to their age. There was a marked reduction in follicular area in old animals. We found significantly lower normalized numbers of follicular PD1hi CD4 T (Tfh) and proliferating (Ki67hi ) GC B cells with aging, a profile associated with significantly higher numbers of potential follicular suppressor FoxP3hi Lag3hi CD4 T cells. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between Tfh and follicular CD8 T cells (fCD8) only in young animals. Despite the increased levels of circulating preinflammatory factors in aging, young animals had higher numbers of monocytes and granulocytes in the follicles, a profile negatively associated with numbers of Tfh cells. Multiple regression analysis showed an altered association between GC B cells and other GC immune cell populations in old animals suggesting a differential mechanistic regulation of GC activity in aging. Our data demonstrate defective baseline GC composition in old NHPs and provide an immunological base for further understanding the adaptive humoral responses with respect to aging.',\n",

       " \"Indirubins E804 (indirubin-3'-(2,3 dihydroxypropyl)-oximether) and 7BIO (7-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime) are synthetic derivatives of natural indirubin, the active compound in Danggui Longhui Wan, a traditional Chinese remedy for cancer and inflammation. Herein, we explore E804 and 7BIO for their potential to modulate key pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines in LN-18 and T98G glioblastoma cells. High grade gliomas typically secrete large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that promote tumor growth in an autocrine fashion. Inflammation is emerging as a key concern in the success of new treatment modalities for glioblastomas. Studies indicate that select indirubin derivatives bind and activate signaling of the AHR pathway, as well as inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases and STAT3 signaling. AHR signaling is involved in hematopoiesis, immune function, cell cycling, and inflammation, and thus may be a possible target for glioma treatment. To determine the significance of the AHR pathway in LN-18 and T98G glioma inflammatory profiles, and on the effects of E804 and 7BIO on these profiles, we used 6,2',4'-trimethoxyflavone (TMF), a putative selective AHR antagonist. It was confirmed that E804 and 7BIO activates the AHR leading to cyp1b1 expression, and that TMF antagonizes expression. We then employed a commercial cancer inflammation and immunity crosstalk qRT-PCR array to screen for anti-inflammatory related properties. TMF alone inhibited expression of ifng, ptsg2, il12b, tnfa, il10, il13, the balance between pd1 and pdl1, and even expression of mhc1a/b. E804 was very potent in suppressing many pro-inflammatory genes, including il1a, il1b, il12a, ptgs2, tlr4, and others. E804 also affected expression of il6, vegfa, and stat3. Conversely, 7BIO induced cox2, but suppressed a different selection of pro-inflammatory genes including nos2, tnfa, and igf1. Secretion of IL-6 protein, an iconic inflammatory cytokine, was decreased by E804. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) protein secretion was upregulated by 7BIO, yet downregulated by E804 and E804 plus TMF. Thus, E804 is both an AHR ligand and regulator of important pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and oncogene STAT3, among others. Our results point to the use of E804 and TMF in combination as a promising new treatment for glioblastoma.\",\n",

For CRP, medical records were reviewed and 34 patients with measured CRP within the 7 days before and after the treatment were evaluated. In the 10 patients analyzed for IL-6/TNF-α, the serum levels of IL-6/TNF-α were not significantly different between pre- and post-initial PD1-I [IL-6 20.3 (2.6-49.9) and 22.9 (3.6-96.1) pg/mL, p\\u2009=\\u20090.453; TNF-α 1.6 (0.7-6.3) and 3.3 (0.7-9.6) pg/mL, p\\u2009=\\u20090.329]; however, all four responses were observed among the 7 IL-6-elevated cases, resulting in a response rate of 57%.

       " 'Most microbes invading through mucosal surfaces cause disease and therefore strategies to induce mucosal immune responses are strongly needed. Vitamin A metabolites, such as retinoic acid (RA), play crucial roles in programming T and B cells to home to mucosal compartments, therefore we evaluated the capacity of RA to elicit mucosal immune responses against tuberculosis (TB) after parenteral vaccination. We found that mice immunized through subcutaneous injections with the TB subunit vaccine (CAF01+H56) in presence of RA show enhanced mucosal H56-specific IgA responses and enhanced Ag-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes homing to the lung as compared with control mice. Immunization with CAF01+H56 in presence of RA resulted in lower bacterial loads in the lungs of mice 14 days after challenge with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as compared to mice immunized in the absence of RA or vaccinated with BCG. Higher amounts of IFNγ and IL-17 pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in lung homogenates of mice immunized with CAF01+H56 and RA 24 h after Mtb infection. However, 6 weeks after infection the protection was comparable in vaccinated mice with or without RA even though treatment with RA during immunization is able to better contain the inflammatory response by the host. Furthermore, at later stage of the infection a higher percentage of Mtb specific CD4+PD1+ T lymphocytes were found in the lungs of mice immunized with CAF01+H56 and RA. These data show that an enhanced mucosal immune response is generated during parenteral vaccination in presence of RA. Furthermore, RA treatment contained the bacterial growth at an early stage of the infection and limited the inflammatory response in the lung at later time points.',\n",
       " 'Collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1) is a gene that has been associated with tumor progression in human prostate cancer (PC). The tumor immune microenvironment has been linked with disease outcome in PC. In the present study, the correlation between CTHRC1 with PC recurrence and the tumor immunological microenvironment was investigated. Using the data supplied by the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), the expression of CTHRC1, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‑1), and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD‑L1) were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining of CTHRC1, PD‑1 and PD‑L1 was performed using a tissue microarray construction of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) specimens. In PRAD, an association was reported between the CTHRC1 expression and the disease free survival (DFS) rate (P=0.022). Overexpression of CTHRC1 was correlated with increased levels of PD‑1 (R=0.272, P=0.021) and PD‑L1 (R=0.298, P=0.016), elevated levels of infiltrating B cells (P=9.51e‑11), CD4+ cells (P=1.51e‑11), macrophages (P=8.25e‑5), neutrophils (P=2.17e‑9) and dendritic cells (P=3.13e‑13). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that CTHRC1 was correlated with the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase‑9, mucin 1 and solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1 genes, which exert an influence in PRAD. The occurrence of this condition is most likely to be associated with regulation of the tumor microenvironment. Taken together, we demonstrated that the prognosis and immunity of PC are closely linked to CTHRC1 upregulation. Furthermore, these results suggest that the immune function of PC may be suppressed by CTHRC1‑targeting therapy.',\n",

We conducted a retrospective review of our initial six patients with metastatic ACC, for whom mitotane alone or with chemotherapy failed, and who were subsequently treated with a combination of pembrolizumab and mitotane, between July 2016 and March 2019. Imaging was analyzed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 1.1 criteria. Two patients had a partial response and four patients had stable disease (8 to 19 months). One patient had grade 3 hepatitis and pembrolizumab was discontinued after 8 months. She died with disease progression 16 months after initiating pembrolizumab. One patient developed brain metastasis after 19 months of treatment and was transitioned to hospice. One patient had focal pneumonitis after 18 months of treatment, and pembrolizumab was discontinued. Three remaining patients continue pembrolizumab plus mitotane at the time of this writing. The current standard of care for ACC is a combination of etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and mitotane with an overall survival of 14.8 months. All six patients lived for at least 16 months after starting pembrolizumab added to mitotane therapy. The therapy appeared to be effective in both microsatellite instability-high and microsatellite stable tumors, suggesting some synergistic effect with mitotane. Combined immunotherapy and mitotane should be considered in future clinical trials in patients with ACC.',\n",

       " 'The fist in class CD38-targeting antibody, daratumumab, is currently approved as single agent and in combination with standards of care for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Based on the high activity and favorable toxicity profile of daratumumab, other CD38 antibodies, such as isatuximab, MOR202, and TAK-079, are being evaluated in MM and other malignancies. The CD38-targeting antibodies have classic Fc-dependent immune effector mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). These mechanisms of action are dependent on CD38 expression on the tumor cells. There is increasing evidence that CD38 antibodies also improve host-anti-tumor immune response by eliminating CD38-positive immune suppressor cells, including regulatory T cells, regulatory B cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Indeed, daratumumab treatment results in a marked increase in T cell numbers and activity. CD38-targeting antibodies probably also reduce adenosine production in the bone marrow microenvironment, which may contribute to improved T cell activity. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that CD38-targeting antibodies have synergistic activity with several other anti-cancer drugs, including various agents with immune stimulating activity, such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide, as well as PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors.',\n",

       " 'Environmental and genetic factors play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) defined as the most common cancer of skin. Programmed death-1 (PD-1), encoded by programmed cell death-1 (PDCD1) gene, serves as an inhibitory molecule in the suppression of immune responses and a risk factor in the development of different cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within PDCD1 gene, and haplotypes defined by these SNPs, in the development of BCC in an Iranian population. Whole blood samples were obtained from 210 BCC and 320 healthy subjects. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to genotype determinations of PD1.3 (rs11568821) and PD1.5 (rs2227981) SNPs, and 4 haplotypes were constructed by PDCD1 SNPs. The frequency of G allele of PD1.3 was significantly higher in BCC patients than healthy subjects (p\\xa0<\\xa00.02), while these significant differences were not observed in the frequencies of PD1.5 alleles between BCC and healthy subjects. Moreover, we found that there were no statistically significant differences in PD1.3 and PD1.5 genotypes between BCC and control groups. Of all estimated haplotypes for PDCD1, only AC haplotype was associated with BCC (OR\\xa0=\\xa00.22, 95% CI\\xa0=\\xa00.06-0.79, p\\xa0<\\xa00.01). These findings suggest that PD1.3G allele and AC haplotype of PDCD1 contribute to BCC in the Iranian population.

With the development of clinical trials of programmed death‑1 (PD‑1)/PD‑ligand\\xa01\\xa0(PD‑L1) blockade, PD‑L1 expression and a high tumor mutation burden become possible biomarkers that could be used to predict immune responses. In this study, based on WES and GEP data from 1,734\\xa0tumors from the HOPE project, we established a tumor microenvironment (TME) immune‑type classification consisting of 4\\xa0types to evaluate the immunological status of cancer patients and analyze immunological pathways specific for immune types. Project HOPE was conducted in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines for Human Genome and Genetic Analysis Research with the approval of the Institutional Review Board. Based on the expression level of the PD‑L1 and CD8B genes, the immunological status was divided into 4\\xa0types as follows: A, PD‑L1+CD8B+; B, PD‑L1+CD8B‑; C,\\xa0PD‑L1‑CD8B‑; and D, PD‑L1‑CD8B+. Type\\xa0A, with PD‑L1+ and CD8B+, exhibited an upregulation of cytotoxic T\\xa0lymphocyte\\xa0(CTL) killing‑associated genes, T‑cell activation genes, antigen‑presentation and dendritic cell\\xa0(DC) maturation genes, and T‑cell‑attracting chemokine genes, which promoted Th1 antitumor responses. By contrast, type\\xa0C, with PD‑L1‑ and CD8B‑, exhibited a low expression of T‑cell‑activating genes and an upregulation of cancer driver gene signaling, which suggested an immune‑suppressive status. With regard to hypermutator tumors, PD‑L1+ hypermutator cases exhibited a specific upregulation of the IL6 gene compared with the PD‑L1‑ cases. On the whole, our data indicate that the classification of the TME immune types may prove to be a useful tool for evaluating the immunological status and predicting antitumor responses and prognosis.',\n",

       " 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a fibrotic stroma with a poor lymphocyte infiltrate, in part driven by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs, which express fibroblast activation protein (FAP), contribute to immune escape via exclusion of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells from cancer cells, upregulation of immune checkpoint ligand expression, immunosuppressive cytokine production, and polarization of tumor infiltrating inflammatory cells. FAP is a post-proline peptidase selectively expressed during tissue remodeling and repair, such as with wound healing, and in the tumor microenvironment by cancer-associated fibroblasts. We targeted FAP function using a novel small molecule inhibitor, UAMC-1110, and mice with germline knockout of FAP and concomitant knock-in of E. coli beta-galactosidase. We depleted CAFs by adoptive transfer of anti-βgal T cells into the FAP knockout animals. Established syngeneic pancreatic tumors in immune competent mice were targeted with these 3 strategies, followed by focal radiotherapy to the tumor. FAP loss was associated with improved antigen-specific tumor T cell infiltrate and enhanced collagen deposition. However, FAP targeting alone or with tumor-directed radiation did not improve survival even when combined with anti-PD1 therapy. Targeting of CAFs alone or in combination with radiation did not improve survival. We conclude that targeting FAP and CAFs in combination with radiation is capable of enhancing anti-tumor T cell infiltrate and function, but does not result in sufficient tumor clearance to extend survival.',\n",
       " 'Nivolumab, a fully human immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody inhibiting the programmed cell death protein-1 receptor, demonstrated robust efficacy and a manageable safety profile across multiple tumor types in clinical trials. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab for pretreated patients with non-small cell lung cancers in clinical practice. In this observational monocentric retrospective study, 98 patients were enrolled between February 2015 and February 2016. The global median overall survival was 6.34 months (95% confidence interval (CI) : 4.11-10.88) and the global median progression free survival was 1.84 months (95% CI: 1.68-2.73). In the univariate analysis, clinical performance status score was the only factor significantly correlated with overall survival.

       " 'Antigen-primed cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells interact with B cells in the germinal centers (GCs) of lymph nodes to generate vaccine-induced antibody (Ab) responses. In the circulation, peripheral Tfh (pTfh) cells, a subset of memory CD4 T cells, serve as surrogates for GC Tfh because of several functional and phenotypic similarities between them. We investigated features of H1N1 influenza antigen-specific pTfh (Ag.pTfh) in virologically controlled HIV+ volunteers on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and healthy control (HC) participants selected from a seasonal influenza vaccine responsiveness study. Selection of the participants was made based on age, defined as young (18-40 y) and old (>60 y) and on their classification as a vaccine responder (VR) or vaccine nonresponder (VNR). VRs demonstrated expansion of CD40L+ and CD69+ Ag.pTfh, with induction of intracellular interleukin 21 (IL-21) and inducible costimulator (ICOS) post vaccination; these responses were strongest in young HC VRs and were less prominent in HIV+ individuals of all ages. Ag.pTfh in VNRs exhibited dramatically different characteristics from VRs, displaying an altered phenotype and a cytokine profile dominated by cytokines IL-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), or IL-17 but lacking in IL-21. In coculture experiments, sorted pTfh did not support the B cell IgG production in VNRs and were predominantly an inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1)/T helper 17 (Th17) phenotype with lower ICOS and higher programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) expression. Induction of IL-21 and ICOS on Ag.pTfh cells are negatively affected by both aging and HIV infection. Our findings demonstrate that dysfunctional Ag.pTfh cells with an altered IL-21/IL-2 axis contribute to inadequate vaccine responses. Approaches for targeting inflammation or expanding functional Tfh may improve vaccine responses in healthy aging and those aging with HIV infection.',\n",

       " 'Developing an active and stable metal single-atom catalyst (SAC) is challenging due to the high surface free energy of metal atoms. In this work, we report that tailoring of the 5d state of Pt1 single atoms on Co3O4 through strong electronic metal-support interactions (EMSIs) boosts the activity up to 68-fold higher than those on other supports in dehydrogenation of ammonia borane for room-temperature hydrogen generation. More importantly, this catalyst also exhibits excellent stability against sintering and leaching, in sharp contrast to the rapid deactivation observed on other Pt single-atom and nanoparticle catalysts. Detailed spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the EMSI tailors the unoccupied 5d state of Pt1 single atoms, which modulates the adsorption of ammonia borane and facilities hydrogen desorption, thus leading to the high activity. Such extraordinary electronic promotion was further demonstrated on Pd1/Co3O4 and in hydrogenation reactions, providing a new promising way to design advanced SACs with high activity and stability.',\n",
       " 'An important challenge in cancer immunotherapy is to expand the number of patients that benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (CI), a fact that has been related to the pre-existence of an efficient anti-tumor immune response. Different strategies are being proposed to promote tumor immunity and to be used in combined therapies with CI. Recently, we reported that intratumoral administration of naked poly A:U, a dsRNA mimetic empirically used in early clinical trials with some success, delays tumor growth and prolongs mice survival in several murine cancer models. Here, we show that CD103+ cDC1 and, to a much lesser extent CD11b+ cDC2, are the only populations expressing TLR3 at the tumor site, and consequently could be potential targets of poly A:U. Upon poly A:U administration these cells become activated and elicit profound changes in the composition of the tumor immune infiltrate, switching the immune suppressive tumor environment to anti-tumor immunity. The sole administration of naked poly A:U promotes striking changes within the lymphoid compartment, with all the anti-tumoral parameters being enhanced: a higher frequency of CD8+ Granzyme B+ T cells, (lower Treg/CD8+ ratio) and an important expansion of tumor-antigen specific CD8+ T cells. Also, PD1/PDL1 showed an increased expression indicating that neutralization of this axis could be exploited in combination with poly A:U.

If the TSM truly describes the SHI-matter interaction mechanism, any non-linearity in x-variation of G must also result in a similar non-linearity in the x-dependence of mixing. Experimentally, the extent of mixing has been parametrized by the irradiation induced change Δσ2 in variances of Pd and Ni depth profiles derived from XPS. Computationally, G determined using density functional theory has been used to solve the equations appropriate to the TSM, and then an equivalent quantity L2, proportional to Δσ2, has been calculated. Both Δσ2(x) and L2(x) show non-linearities, albeit in slightly dissimilar ways, leading to a conjecture that the present work at least does not invalidate the TSM.',\n",
       " 'The therapeutic landscape in metastatic melanoma has changed dramatically in the last decade, with the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors resulting in durable responses for a large number of patients. For patients with BRAF mutations, combinations of BRAF and MEK inhibitors demonstrated response rates and benefit comparable to those from immune checkpoint inhibitors, providing the rationale for sequential treatment with targeted and immunotherapies and raising the question of optimal treatment sequencing.Biomarkers for the selection of anti-PD-1 therapy in BRAF wild type (BRAF WT) and in BRAF mutated (BRAF MUT) patients help development of alternative treatments for patients unlikely to benefit, and might lead to better understanding of the interaction of checkpoint inhibition and targeted therapy. In this paper we evaluate the performance of a previously developed serum proteomic test, BDX008, in metastatic melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 agents and investigate the role of BRAF mutation status. BDX008, a pre-treatment proteomic test associated with acute phase reactants, wound healing and complement activation, stratifies patients into two groups, BDX008+ and BDX008-, with better and worse outcomes on immunotherapy.Serum samples were available from 71 patients treated with anti-PD1 inhibitors; 25 patients had BRAF mutations, 39 were wild type. Overall, BDX008+ patients had significantly better overall survival (OS) (HR\\u2009=\\u20090.50, P\\u2009=\\u20090.016) and a trend for better progression-free survival (PFS) (HR\\u2009=\\u20090.61, P\\u2009=\\u20090.060) than BDX008- patients. BDX008 classification was statistically significant in the analyses adjusted for mutation status, LDH, and line of treatment (P\\u2009=\\u20090.009 for OS and 0.031 for PFS). BRAF WT BDX008+ patients had markedly long median OS of 32.5\\u2009months and 53% landmark 2\\u2009years survival, with statistically significantly superior OS as compared to BDX008- patients (HR\\u2009=\\u20090.41, P\\u2009=\\u20090.032). The difference between BDX008+ and BDX008- in PFS in BRAF WT patients and in OS and PFS in BRAF MUT patients did not reach statistical significance, though numerically was consistent with overall results.

Expression of programmed cell death ligand‑1 (PDL‑1), 7‑amino‑actinomycin D and human leukocyte antigen‑DR (HLA‑DR), and the levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were determined. Levels of programmed cell death‑1 (PD‑1) and CD25 were assessed in T cells co‑cultured with neutrophils. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells were co‑cultured with dendritic cells and neutrophils to examine their proliferation. CD15 and PD‑1 immunohistochemical staining was also performed to explore the positional relationship. The results revealed that the neutrophils incubated with TTCS showed upregulation of PDL‑1 expression, as well as a decreases in the ratio of apoptotic cells, expression of HLA‑DR, and levels of H2O2. CD4+ T cells co‑cultured with neutrophils conditioned with TTCS showed a decrease in proliferation, upregulation of PD‑1 expression, and downregulation of CD25 expression. IHC showed that PD‑1+ T cells formed clusters and TANs infiltrated around the clusters. In conclusion, neutrophils in gastric cancer tissue inhibit the proliferation of CD4+ T cells and may form a local immunosuppressive environment through the PD‑1/PDL‑1 pathway.',\n",
       " 'The objective of this manuscript is to identify the neurological side effect profile associated with different classes of antibodies used in cancer pharmacotherapy and to estimate the frequency in which these neurotoxicity occurs. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using OVID MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for articles written between January of 2010 till August of 2018. The spectrum of neurotoxicity was searched using expanded terminology, medical subject headings, truncation, spelling variations and database specific controlled vocabulary. 2134 citations were retrieved that were narrowed down to 151 when SORT 1 or SORT 2 critical appraisal tool was applied to articles with human subjects. Meta-analysis using random effect model was done to estimate the prevalence of neurological symptoms per class of antibody described in SORT1 and SORT2 articles. It was found that the most common neurotoxicity per antibody class are as follows; Bi-specific T-cell engagers was headache 38% [35-40%; I2 0%]; anti-CD20, neuropathy, 16% [7-24%, I2 65%]; anti-CD30, neuropathy 57% [46-68%, I2 72%]; anti-CD52, neuropathy 5-15%; anti-CTL4, headache 12% [7-16%, I2 49%]; anti-EGFR, headache 25% [11-38%, I2 92%]; anti-Her2, neuropathy 33% [18-49%, I2 98%]; anti-PD1 and PDL1, headache 3% [2-5%, I2 85%]; and anti-VEGF, headache 25% [16-35%, I2 73%]. Therefore, all classes of antibodies used in cancer pharmacotherapy have associated neurotoxicity with a wide spectrum of effects afflicting the nervous system as a whole.

Here, we showed that the class I HDAC inhibitor, entinostat (ENT), promoted the expression of immune-modulatory molecules, including MHCII, costimulatory ligands, and chemokines on murine breast tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. ENT also impaired tumor growth in vivo-an effect that was dependent on both CD8+ T cells and IFNγ. Moreover, ENT promoted intratumoral T-cell clonal expansion and enhanced their functional activity. Importantly, ENT sensitized normally unresponsive tumors to the effects of PD1 blockade, predominantly through increases in T-cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that class I HDAC inhibitors impair tumor growth by enhancing the proliferative and functional capacity of CD8+ T cells and by sensitizing tumor cells to T-cell recognition.',\n",

Aside from its ω-monohydroxylated metabolite, little has been reported on its metabolic fate.

These data represent the first evidence of β-oxidation occurring in specialized proresolving mediators and show that the biotransformation of NPD1 by human hepatoma cells is extremely rapid and faster than that of leukotriene (LTE4). Unlike LTE4, the main metabolic process occurs from the polar head chain of NPD1. It may limit NPD1 systemic circulation and prevent its urinary excretion, making difficult its detection and quantitation in vivo.

Although dominant in mediating T cell dysfunction in cancer, it is now well-accepted that interruption of PD-1/PD-L1 axes alone does not always completely restore T cell function, indicating the involvement of additional negative regulatory pathways, such as TIM-3/Gal-9, in promoting T cell exhaustion.Here, we characterized these pathways in AML patients enrolled in a phase I dose escalation trial that combined Selinexor, a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE), with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) and mitoxantrone (Mito) (NCT02573363) as induction therapy.To monitor changes in expression of immune checkpoint receptors, multi-parameter flow cytometry was performed on peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy specimens at diagnosis and following induction therapy in 26 AML patients. Expression of CD47, PD-L1, PD-L2 and Gal9 was assessed on CD34+ AML blasts, as well as on CD34- cell populations. In parallel, we evaluated expression of inhibitory (PD1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM-3) and stimulatory (CD28, ICOS, CD137, OX40, CD40L, HLA-DR) co-receptors on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets.Compared to baseline, the frequency of Gal9+ CD34- cells was significantly higher in patients with treatment failure (TF) than in those in complete remission (CR), and this finding correlated with increased TIM-3 expression on marrow-resident T cells in TF patients. Moreover, when we measured the expression level of PD-1 and TIM-3 in bone marrow samples compared to peripheral blood, TIM-3 was significantly higher in BM specimens.Our results suggest that targeting the Gal9/Tim-3 axis could be effective in combination with induction chemotherapy to increase the likelihood of complete remission in AML patients.',\n",

These LL-37-DC enhanced proliferation, activation and cytokine production by CD8+ (but not CD4+) T cells in vitro and in vivo. Critically, tumor antigen-presenting LL-37-DC increased migration of primed, activated CD8+ T cells into established squamous cell carcinomas in mice, and resulted in tumor regression. This advance therefore has the potential to dramatically enhance DC immunotherapy protocols.',\n",

       " 'Chronic inflammation may drive development of cancer as observed in inflammation-induced colorectal cancer (CRC). Though immune cells can infiltrate the tumour microenvironment, cancer cells seem to evade anti-tumour responses, which is one of the established hallmarks of cancer. Targeting the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 signalling pathway is currently at the forefront in the development of anti-tumour immunity-based therapies for multiple malignancies. By blocking the immune-checkpoint of activated T-cells, it is possible to rewire the adaptive resistance induced by the PD-1 ligands expressed in the tumour microenvironment. However, adverse immunotherapy-modulated events could complicate the treatment of individuals with preexisting chronic inflammatory conditions. In this study, we investigated the expression of different systemic and mucosal T-cell subsets during the course of azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and colitis-associated CRC. In addition, we examined the expression of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 as well as other molecular targets related to T-cell exhaustion. We found a significant increase in PD-1 expression on all examined mucosal T-cell subsets of the colon and the ileum, which correlated with disease progression. We also observed an upregulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expression throughout the AOM/DSS regime. Blocking PD-1 signalling with an anti-PD1 antibody did not affect the tumour burden in the AOM/DSS-treated mice, but did potentiate the weight loss in the third DSS cycle, indicating possible immune-mediated toxicity. This raises a concern for patients with colitis-associated CRCs and should be further investigated.',\n",

This review aims to evaluate the evidence for differences in tumours within Merkel cell carcinoma and to stratify these. A literature search of research pertaining to various characteristics MCC was undertaken from 1972, when Merkel cell carcinoma was first described, to 2018, using PubMed and similar search engines. 41 papers were analysed, including clinical trials, laboratory-based research and reviews. A proportion of MCC has Merkel cell polyomavirus genome integrated (MCPyV+) while others do not (MCPyV-negative). Both types have a different mutation burden. MCPyV+ tumours are likely true neuroendocrine carcinomas, with a dermal origin, probably from fibroblasts which have been transformed by integration of the viral genome. MCPyV-negative tumours are likely derived from either keratinocytes or epidermal stem cells, are probably squamous cell carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation, and are related to sun damage. Prognostic factors (apart from tumour stage) include the MCPyV status, with MCPyV+ tumours having a better prognosis. P63 expression confers a worse prognosis in most studies. CD8+ lymphocytes play an important role, providing a possible target for PD1/PD-L1 blockade treatment. The incidence of MCC varies from country to country. Countries such as Australia have a high rate and a far greater proportion of MCPyV-negative tumours than places such as the United Kingdom. MCC doubtlessly encompasses two tumours. There is with demonstrated differences relevance regarding prognosis and management. One is a neuroendocrine carcinoma related to MCPyV integration likely derived from fibroblasts, and the other is a UV-related squamous cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation, presumptively derived from either keratinocytes or epidermal stem cells. We propose naming the former Merkel type sarcoma and the latter squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel type.',\n",

We show here that antitumor responses by natural killer (NK) cells can be enhanced by a checkpoint-blocking mAb, 14-25-9, which we developed against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA is expressed on the surface of cancer cells and acts as an inhibitory ligand for the NK-cell receptor, NKp44-isoform1. We tested for cytoplasmic- and membrane-associated PCNA by FACS- and ImageStream-based staining of cell lines and IHC of human cancer formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues. The mAb, 14-25-9, inhibited binding of chimeric NKp44 receptor to PCNA and mostly stained the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells, whereas commercial antibody (clone PC10) stained nuclear PCNA. NK functions were measured using ELISA-based IFNγ secretion assays and FACS-based killing assays. The NK92-NKp44-1 cell line and primary human NK cells showed increased IFNγ release upon coincubation with mAb 14-25-9 and various solid tumor cell lines and leukemias. Treatment with 14-25-9 also increased NK cytotoxic activity. In vivo efficacy was evaluated on patient-derived xenografts (PDX)-bearing NSG mice. In PDX-bearing mice, intravenous administration of mAb 14-25-9 increased degranulation (CD107a expression) of intratumorally injected patient autologous or allogeneic NK cells, as well as inhibited tumor growth when treated long term. Our study describes a mAb against the NKp44-PCNA innate immune checkpoint that can enhance NK-cell antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.',\n",

       " 'Improved understanding of the immune system and its role in cancer development and progression has led to impressive advances in the field of cancer immunotherapy over the last decade. Whilst the field is rapidly evolving and the list of drugs receiving regulatory approval for the treatment of various cancers is fast growing, the group of PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors is establishing a leading role amongst immunomodulatory agents. PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors act against pathways involved in adaptive immune suppression resulting in immune checkpoint blockade. Within the last four years two PD-1 and three PD-L1 inhibitors have been utilized in clinical practice against a variety of malignancies. Focus was initially placed on targeting cancers considered immunogenic such as melanoma, renal and lung cancers but subsequently the application expanded to include amongst others Hodgkin Lymphoma, urothelial as well as head and neck cancer. This article provides a comprehensive review of the early and late phase trials that led to the regulatory approval of all five PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors in the corresponding cancer types. It presents available data on the combinations of PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors with other therapies (immunotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy), the toxicity profile of the PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors and ongoing trials testing the efficacy of these agents in cancer types beyond those that have been addressed already. Finally, current and future challenges in the application of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are discussed with emphasis on the role of predictive biomarkers.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to explore whether combinational immunotherapy is effective for treating malignant glioblastoma in vitro. The therapeutic efficacy of third generation anti‑human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)‑T cells alone and in combination with PD1 blockade was investigated for the treatment of malignant glioblastoma cells in vitro. Anti‑HER2 CAR‑T cells were prepared by transducing activated primary human T cells with lentiviruses which expressed third generation anti‑HER2 CAR. The CAR‑positive cell ratio was detected using flow cytometry. The expression level of CAR was detected by western blot analysis. The binding of anti‑HER2 CAR‑T cells to HER2+ U251 glioblastoma cells was examined under a fluorescence microscope. The cytokine secretion of CAR‑T cells induced by target cells was analyzed via ELISA. The cytotoxicity of anti‑HER2 CAR‑T cells alone or in combination with anti‑programmed death‑1 (PD1) antibody against HER2+/PDL1+ U251 cells was examined using an LDH assay. The CAR‑positive cell ratio and expression level of CAR in prepared CAR‑T cells were both high enough. Anti‑HER2 CAR‑T cells could specifically bind to U251 cells. The IL‑2 and IFN‑γ secretion of CAR‑T cells increased after being co‑cultured with U251 cells, and further increased in the presence of anti‑PD1 antibody. Anti‑HER2 CAR‑T cells displayed a potent cytotoxicity against U251 cells. In addition, the presence of anti‑PD1 antibody further enhanced the efficacy of anti‑HER2 CAR‑T cells against U251 cells. The present results indicated that blocking PD1 immuno‑suppression can increase the activation of CAR‑T cells after they are activated by a targeting antigen. Third generation anti‑HER2 CAR‑T cells along with PD1 blockade have a great therapeutic potential for combatting malignant glioblastoma.',\n",

Here, we demonstrate an effective modulation of that stroma by irreversible electroporation (IRE), a local ablation technique that has received regulatory approval in the United States. IRE induces immunogenic cell death, activates dendritic cells, and alleviates stroma-induced immunosuppression without depleting tumor-restraining collagen. The combination of IRE and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) immune checkpoint blockade promotes selective tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells and significantly prolongs survival in a murine orthotopic PDAC model with a long-term memory immune response. Our results suggest that IRE is a promising approach to potentiate the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in PDAC.',\n",

       " 'HIV-1 frequently escapes from CD8 T cell responses via HLA-I restricted adaptation, leading to the accumulation of adapted epitopes (AE). We previously demonstrated that AE compromise CD8 T cell responses during acute infection and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Here, we examined the impact of AE on CD8 T cell responses and their biological relevance in chronic HIV infection (CHI). In contrast to acute infection, the majority of AE are immunogenic in CHI. Longitudinal analyses from acute to CHI showed an increased frequency and magnitude of AE-specific IFNγ responses compared to NAE-specific ones. These AE-specific CD8 T cells also were more cytotoxic to CD4 T cells. In addition, AE-specific CD8 T cells expressed lower levels of PD1 and CD57, as well as higher levels of CD28, suggesting a more activated and less exhausted phenotype. During CHI, viral sequencing identified AE-encoding strains as the dominant quasispecies. Despite increased CD4 T cell cytotoxicity, CD8 T cells responding to AE promoted dendritic cell (DC) maturation and CD4 T cell trans-infection perhaps explaining why AE are predominant in CHI. Taken together, our data suggests that the emergence of AE-specific CD8 T cell responses in CHI confers a selective advantage to the virus by promoting DC-mediated CD4 T cell trans-infection.',\n",

       " 'CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has changed the outcomes of relapsed/refractory B‑cell leukemia and lymphoma. However, its efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory non‑Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been less impressive compared with that in patients with acute lymphoid leukemia. Furthermore, immune checkpoints have a critical role in the immune system. Several clinical trials have confirmed the dramatic effects of programmed death‑1/programmed death‑ligand 1 (PD‑1/PD‑L1) inhibitors in numerous malignancies, but the immune‑associated adverse events of PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors may occur in a number of systems. The aim of the present study was to investigate the combination of CD19 CAR‑T cells with a reduced dose of PD‑1 inhibitor. This method is expected to overcome the side-effects of PD‑1 inhibitors, while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. The findings demonstrated that a reduced dose of PD‑1 inhibitor did not affect the transfection rate, proliferation rate or cytokine secretion of CD19 CAR‑T cells. An interesting finding of the present study was that the number of PD‑1‑positive cells CAR‑T cells, measured by flow cytometry, declined when they were cultured in vitro, but returned to high levels with gradual prolongation of the co‑culture time of CD19 CAR‑T cells with lymphoma cells; however, there was no change in the mRNA expression of T cells and CAR‑T cells during this process. This phenomenon may be one of the reasons why the curative effect of CAR‑T cells on B‑cell lymphoma is unsatisfactory compared with B‑cell leukemia. The synergistic effect of a reduced‑dose PD‑1 inhibitor combined with CD19 CAR‑T cells from T cells highly expressing PD‑1 was confirmed in a mouse trial. Mice in the combined treatment group achieved the longest survival time. In this group, the proportion of CAR‑T cells and the level of interleukin‑6 were higher compared with those in the CAR‑T cell group. In conclusion, a reduced dose of a PD‑1 inhibitor combined with CD19 CAR‑T cells appears to be a promising treatment option for relapsed/refractory B‑NHL exhibiting high PD‑1 expression by T cells. This method may achieve good clinical efficacy while reducing the side-effects of PD‑1 inhibitors.',\n",
       " \"Immune checkpoint blockade therapies fail to induce immune response in the vast majority of cancer patients, so developing robust adjuvants for increasing tumor immune response is central for effective tumor immunotherapy. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a crucial oncogenic signal in relation to tumor immune evasion; however, none of the Wnt inhibitor under clinical or preclinical phases has demonstrated satisfactory specificity. Thus, new compounds or modalities that tumor specifically modulate the Wnt signal will be of great significance and value in clinical tumor immunotherapy. Herein, inspired by a natural phenomenon in cancer cells that the Achilles' Heel of oncoprotein β-catenin, H1 helix, predisposes β-catenin to oligomerization for proteasomal degradation and can be exacerbated by carnosic acid (CA, a Wnt inhibitor), we developed a size-tuned nanocluster (CAcluster) with well-defined supramolecular nanostructure by coassembling CA and H1 peptide. With the inherent enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and the designed tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness, the CAcluster tumor specifically suppress the Wnt/β-catenin cascade in vivo, while maintaining a highly favorable biosafety profile. More importantly, the CAcluster in vivo improved the tumor response to the PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma and colon cancer. This study provides new insights into the biomimetic coassembly strategy to design supramolecular nanostructured adjuvants for hazard-free Wnt suppression and synergy with tumor immunotherapy.\",\n",

       " 'Impressive responses have been observed in patients with cancer treated with checkpoint inhibitory anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibodies through disinhibiting the immune system. However, tumors possess complex immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to present therapeutic obstacles and the response rates to immune checkpoint inhibition remain low. One significant barrier to the efficacy of anti-PD1 treatment is the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into the tumor. MDSCs dramatically increased in peripheral blood of patients with osteosarcoma and prohibited both T-cell activation and infiltration. Here we demonstrated functional inhibition of G-MDSCs with (S)-(-)-N-[2-(3-Hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)-methyl]-acetamide (SNA), a specific inhibitor of PI3Kδ/γ, could prime tumor microenvironment, resultantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1 treatment in a syngeneic osteosarcoma tumor model. Combining SNA with anti-PD1 dramatically slowed osteosarcoma tumor growth and prolonged survival time of tumor-bearing mice, at least in part mediated through CD8+ T cells. Our results demonstrated that addition of SNA to anti-PD1 significantly altered infiltration and function of innate immune cells, providing the rationale for combination therapy in patients with osteosarcoma through inhibiting the function of MDSCs with a selective PI3Kδ/γ inhibitor to enhance responses to immune checkpoint blockade.',\n",
       " 'Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disease characterized by an immune mediated decrease in platelet number. Disturbance of CD4+ T-cell homeostasis with simultaneous decrease of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) as well as unrestricted proliferation and activation of peripheral CD4+ effector T cells underpin the pathophysiology of ITP. Indirubin is an active ingredient of a traditional Chinese herb called Indigofera tinctoria L. which is clinically used for the treatment of ITP patients. Whether indirubin targets the Tregs/effector T cell-axis to restore platelet number is unknown. In our in vitro studies, Indirubin could significantly enhance the number and function of Tregs and meanwhile dampen the activation of effector T cells in a dose-dependent manner. Indirubin was observed to restore the expression of programmed cell-death 1 (PD1) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) on the CD4+ T cells of ITP patients, leading to the subsequent attenuation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, these observations were recapitulated in an active murine model of ITP with a prominent platelet response. Thus, our results identified a potentially novel mechanism of the therapeutic action of indirubin in the treatment of ITP through regulating the homeostasis of CD4+ T cells in a PD1/PTEN/AKT signalling pathway.',\n",
       " 'Only some cancer patients respond to the immune-checkpoint inhibitors being used in the clinic, and other therapeutic targets are sought. Here, we investigated the HLA-G/ILT2 checkpoint in clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients and focused on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (TIL) expressing the HLA-G receptor ILT2. Using transcriptomics and flow cytometry, we characterized both peripheral blood and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ILT2+ T cells from cancer patients as late-differentiated CD27-CD28-CD57+ cytotoxic effectors. We observed a clear dichotomy between CD8+ILT2+ and CD8+PD-1+ TIL subsets. These subsets, which were sometimes present at comparable frequencies in TIL populations, barely overlapped phenotypically and were distinguished by expression of exclusive sets of surface molecules that included checkpoint molecules and activating and inhibitory receptors. CD8+ILT2+ TILs displayed a more mature phenotype and higher expression of cytotoxic molecules. In ex vivo functional experiments with both peripheral blood T cells and TILs, CD8+ILT2+ T cells displayed significantly higher cytotoxicity and IFNγ production than their ILT2- (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC) and PD-1+ (TILs) counterparts. HLA-G expression by target cells specifically inhibited CD8+ILT2+ T-cell cytotoxicity, but not that of their CD8+ILT2- (PBMC) or CD8+PD-1+ (TIL) counterparts, an effect counteracted by blocking the HLA-G/ILT2 interaction. CD8+ILT2+ TILs may therefore constitute an untapped reservoir of fully differentiated cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment, independent of the PD1+ TILs targeted by immune therapies, and specifically inhibited by HLA-G. These results emphasize the potential of therapeutically targeting the HLA-G/ILT2 checkpoint in HLA-G+ tumors, either concomitantly with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or in cases of nonresponsiveness to anti-PD-1/PD-L1.',\n",

       " 'Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of colorectal liver metastases activates a specific T-cell response that is ineffective in avoiding recurrence. Recently, local immunomodulation garnered interests as a way to improve the immune response. We were interested in improving the RFA immune response priming to propose a curative treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on antitumor immunity. First, we demonstrated that the RFA did not increase the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in secondary distant tumors of patients and in mice model and could not avoid relapse. Remarkably, RFA and in situ immunomodulation with GM-CSF-BCG hydrogel induced complete cure of microscopic secondary lesions in mice, related to a strong specific immune response. Then, we demonstrated that the immune escape of large secondary lesions was reversed by addition of the systemic PD-1 blockade to the in situ immunomodulation. The lack of an effective distant immune response in patients treated with RFA confirmed the relevance of this new combination strategy. Increasing the in situ priming response of radiofrequency ablation provides effective adjuvants to induce an abscopal effect. In the case of large lesions, synergy between PD1 blockade inhibitor, ineffective alone or after single RFA, with in situ immunomodulation, could lead to reconsideration of the use of checkpoint inhibition in metastatic MSS CRC.',\n",

       " 'Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are heterogeneous cancers associated with a very poor prognosis. The improvement of prognostic tools and systemic therapy are urgently needed. Targeting the immune system using checkpoint inhibitors such as PD1/PDL1 inhibitors is an attractive novel therapeutic strategy for poor-prognosis tumors. Multiple clinical trials are ongoing, including in advanced ACC. However, PDL1 expression has been studied in ACC in only one heterogeneous series of 28 clinical samples. Here, we have retrospectively analyzed PDL1 mRNA expression in 146 clinical ACC samples and searched for correlations between expression and biological and clinicopathological data, including post-operative disease-free survival (DFS). PDL1 mRNA expression was heterogeneous across samples. \"PDL1-high\" tumors were not associated with the classical prognostic variables but were associated with longer DFS in both uni- and multivariate analyses. High PDL1 mRNA expression was associated with biological signs of the cytotoxic local immune response. Supervised analysis between \"PDL1-high\" and \"PDL1-low\" tumors identified a robust 370-gene signature whose ontology analysis suggested the existence in \"PDL1-high\" tumors of a cytotoxic T-cell response, however, associated with some degree of T-cell exhaustion. In conclusion, PDL1 mRNA expression refines the prognostication in ACC and high expression is associated with longer DFS. Clinical validation at the protein level and functional validation are required to fully understand the role of PDL1 in ACC. Reactivation of dormant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by PDL1-inhibitors could represent a promising strategy in \"PDL1-high\" ACCs, supporting the ongoing clinical trials.',\n",

Anti-CD3 activated PBMCs from twenty healthy donors and fifty-two patients with AEDs were cocultured on f-LSC monolayer. 2D-DIGE proteomic experiments, mass spectrometry sequencing and functional in vitro assays were assessed in cocultured PBMCs. We identified the downmodulation of several human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1) isoforms in healthy and AED activated PBMCs upon f-LSC interaction. The reduction of hnRNPA2/B1 protein expression largely affected the cycling ki67+, CD25+, PD-1+ reactive cells and the double marked CD8+/hnRNPA2B1+ T cell subset. Anti-PD1 blocking experiments evoked hnRNPA2/B1 overexpression, attributing putative activation function to the protein. hnRNPA2/B2 transient silencing inverted immunopolarization of the self-reactive PBMCs from AEDs toward a M2/Th2-type background. Pharmacological inhibition and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the involvement of NF-ĸB in hnRNPA2/B activity and turnover.

More importantly, loss of function of inhibitory ICs (including PD1, PD-L1, and CD152) markedly inhibited HO, whereas loss of function of stimulatory ICs (including CD40L and OX-40L) facilitated HO. These findings suggest that IC inhibitors may provide a therapeutic approach to prevent or limit the extent of HO.',\n",

       " 'The introduction of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has transformed the management of advanced bladder cancer (BC). Despite its limitations, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry may serve as a predictive biomarker of anti-PD-L1/PD1 therapy. While urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients with predominant or pure variant histology (UCV) account for up to one-third of advanced cases, to date, most ICB BC studies have excluded patients with such histologies. To assess the potential utility of ICB in patients with UCV, we analyzed PD-L1 expression in UCV and compared 3 commonly used and commercially available PD-L1 antibodies. Full sections from 84 UCV cases were stained with clones SP263, 22C3, and SP142, all of which are considered predictive assays to identify UC patients who are more likely to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, respectively. Expression on tumor cells (TC) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) was assessed. Staining extent and characteristics were evaluated, and concordance among the 3 clones was determined at various cutoff points as used in previous studies in BC. We found that PD-L1 was expressed in a significant percentage of UCV cases at different cutoff points (cutoff 1% TC: 37% to 54%, cutoff 5% TC: 23% to 37%), with the highest expression in UC with squamous differentiation. These figures are equal to or higher than those for classic/pure UC (4% to 30%). The results suggest that patients with UCV may benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and argue against the exclusion of UC with predominant or pure variant histology from clinical ICB studies. The highest expression in both TC and IC was observed with clone SP263, followed by 22C3 and SP142, and all clones showed strong agreement in a pairwise comparison, both in TC and IC (R-values: 0.780 to 0.901), which indicates that all 3 clones are potentially useful in the evaluation of PD-L1 expression in UCV.',\n",

To characterize the effects of HTLV infection, we analysed blood samples from HTLV-infected individuals by flow cytometry. Samples were collected from visitors at the HIV clinic in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. These samples were tested for HTLV and HIV, and 199 were analysed by flow cytometry using panels for B cells, T-cell maturation and activation, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and monocytes. CD80+ cell proportions were significantly higher in HTLV infected than in HTLV uninfected in all B cell subsets.

The discoveries of PD1 and PD-L1 as negative immune checkpoints for T cells have led to the revolution of modern cancer immunotherapy. Multiple agents targeting PD1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4 are widely applied as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) which alleviate the suppression of immune regulatory machineries and lead to immunoablation of once highly refractory cancers such as stage IV lung cancer.

The clinical therapy that dilapidates PD1 or PD-L1-mediated cancer tolerance has pushed out the need to uncover the molecular regulation of PD-L1 overexpression in the tumor cell. In this study, we identify histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia protein 3 (MLL3) as a critical regulator of PD-L1 in prostate cancer cells. MLL3 and PD-L1 were highly expressed in the metastatic cancer tissues, compared to the primary cancer tissues. Furthermore, their expressions were highly correlated in the cancer tissues in the databases of TCGA and Xiangya Hospital. We found that MLL3 bound to the enhancer of PD-L1. Depletion of MLL3 decreased the binding level of H3K4me1 in the enhancer of PD-L1 and Pol II Ser-5p in the promoter of PD-L1. Importantly, MLL3 depletion impaired the mouse xenograft growth and decreased the response to PD-L1 antibody treatment in mice. The findings extend the understanding of the biology regulation of PD-L1 transcription and identify the histone writer MLL3 in an important immune checkpoint, and give prominence to a hidden therapeutic target to conquer immune evasion by tumor cells.',\n",
       " \"Introduction: The advent of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but clinical response to immunotherapies is highly heterogeneous among individual patients and between cancer types. This represents a challenge to oncologists when choosing specific immunotherapies for personalized medicine. Thus, biomarkers that can predict tumor responsiveness to immunotherapies before and during treatment are invaluable. Areas covered: We review the latest advances in 'liquid biopsy' biomarkers for noninvasive prediction and in-treatment monitoring of tumor response to immunotherapy, focusing primarily on melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. We concentrate on high-quality studies published within the last five years on checkpoint blockade immunotherapies, and highlight significant breakthroughs, identify key areas for improvement, and provide recommendations for how these diagnostic tools can be translated into clinical practice. Expert opinion: The first biomarkers proposed to predict tumor response to immunotherapy were based on PD1/PDL1 expression, but their predictive value is limited to specific cancers or patient populations. Recent advances in single-cell molecular profiling of circulating tumor cells and host cells using next-generation sequencing has dramatically expanded the pool of potentially useful predictive biomarkers. As immunotherapy moves toward personalized medicine, a composite panel of both genomic and proteomic biomarkers will have enormous utility in therapeutic decision-making.\",\n",
       " \"The TNF blockade therapy is currently a well-established treatment option for a variety of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis or Crohn's disease, given the proinflammatory role of TNF in the course of these diseases. Importantly, TNF neutralization is also used for the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by the combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. The manifestation of these toxicities is an important limiting factor for the successful implementation of the inhibitory checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB), restraining its anti-tumor efficacy. In our recent study (Perez-Ruiz et al., Nature 569(7756): 428-432.), we analyzed the potential impact of prophylactic TNF neutralization therapy in the anti-PD1/CTLA-4 efficacy. Through several mouse models, we demonstrated that TNF neutralization ameliorated ICB-exacerbated colitis in addition to improving ICB-dependent anti-tumor efficacy. Similar results were obtained after prophylactic TNF blockade in graft vs host xenografted mouse models with human immune cells, which showed a reduction in colitis and hepatitis. Importantly, there was a preservation of the immunotherapeutic control of xenografted tumors after ICB treatment. Moreover, TNF and TNF-dependent gene expression is upregulated in the colon mucosa from patients affected by colitis as a side effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab. Our results, thus, provide evidence of the successful combination of prophylactic TNF neutralization with ICB therapy strategy to ameliorate toxicities, while keeping or even ameliorating anti-tumor efficacy. The prophylactic TNF blockade strategy is clinically feasible since excellent TNF inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of autoimmunity and are used for the immune-related serious adverse events in immunotherapy.\",\n",

       " 'The advent of molecular tension probes for real-time mapping of piconewton forces in living systems has had a major impact on mechanobiology. For example, DNA-based tension probes have revealed roles for mechanics in platelet, B cell, T cell, and fibroblast function. Nonetheless, imaging short-lived forces transmitted by low-abundance receptors remains a challenge. This is a particular problem for mechanoimmunology where ligand-receptor bindings are short lived, and a few antigens are sufficient for cell triggering. Herein, we present a mechanoselection strategy that uses locking oligonucleotides to preferentially and irreversibly bind DNA probes that are mechanically strained over probes at rest. Thus, infrequent and short-lived mechanical events are tagged. This strategy allows for integration and storage of mechanical information into a map of molecular tension history. Upon addition of unlocking oligonucleotides that drive toehold-mediated strand displacement, the probes reset to the real-time state, thereby erasing stored mechanical information. As a proof of concept, we applied this strategy to study OT-1 T cells, revealing that the T cell receptor (TCR) mechanically samples antigens carrying single amino acid mutations. Such events are not detectable using conventional tension probes. Each mutant peptide ligand displayed a different level of mechanical sampling and spatial scanning by the TCR that strongly correlated with its functional potency. Finally, we show evidence that T cells transmit pN forces through the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD1), a major target in cancer immunotherapy. We anticipate that mechanical information storage will be broadly useful in studying the mechanobiology of the immune system.',\n",

TNFSF4 is a co-stimulatory checkpoint protein expressed by several types of immune and non-immune cells, and was shown in the past to enhance the anti-neoplastic activity of T cells. Here, we assessed its expression in melanoma and its association with outcome in locally advanced and metastatic disease. We used publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and RNA sequencing data from anti-PD1-treated patients at Sheba medical center. TNFSF4 mRNA is expressed in melanoma cell lines and melanoma samples, including those with low lymphocytic infiltrates, and is not associated with the ulceration status of the primary tumor. Low expression of TNFSF4 mRNA is associated with worse prognosis in\\xa0all melanoma patients and in the cohorts of stage III and stage IIIc-IV patients. Low expression of TNFSF4 mRNAs is also associated with worse prognosis in the subgroup of patients with low lymphocytic infiltrates, suggesting that tumoral TNFSF4 is associated with outcome. TNFSF4 expression was not correlated with the expression of other known checkpoint mRNAs. Last, metastatic patients with TNFSF4 mRNA expression within the lowest quartile have significantly worse outcome on anti-PD1 treatment, and a significantly lower response rate to these agents.

Multiple trials have addressed the role of checkpoint inhibitors in advanced bladder cancer, including atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab (all targeting the PD1/PD-L1 pathway). While these trials have demonstrated promising results and improvements over existing therapies, less than half of patients with advanced disease demonstrate clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Recent breakthroughs in cancer biology and immunology have led to an improved understanding of the influence of the tumor microenvironment on the host's immune system. It appears that tumors promote the formation of highly immunosuppressive microenvironments preventing generation of effective anti-tumor immune response through multiple mechanisms. Therefore, reconditioning of the tumor microenvironment and restoration of the competent immune response is essential for achieving optimal efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we aim to discuss the major mechanisms of immune evasion in bladder cancer and highlight novel pathways and molecular targets that may help to attenuate tumor-induced immune tolerance, overcome resistance to immunotherapy and improve clinical outcomes.\",\n",
       " 'Tetraspanins are a conserved family of proteins involved in a number of biological processes including, cell-cell interactions, fertility, cancer metastasis and immune responses. It has previously been shown that TSPAN32 knockout mice have normal hemopoiesis and B-cell responses, but hyperproliferative T cells. Here, we show that TSPAN32 is expressed at higher levels in the lymphoid lineage as compared to myeloid cells. In vitro activation of T helper cells via anti-CD3/CD28 is associated with a significant downregulation of TSPAN32. Interestingly, engagement of CD3 is sufficient to modulate TSPAN32 expression, and its effect is potentiated by costimulation with anti-CD28, but not anti-CTLA4, -ICOS nor -PD1. Accordingly, we measured the transcriptomic levels of TSPAN32 in polarized T cells under Th1 and Th2 conditions and TSPAN32 resulted significantly reduced as compared with unstimulated cells. On the other hand, in Treg cells, TSPAN32 underwent minor changes upon activation. The in vitro data were finally translated into the context of multiple sclerosis (MS). Encephalitogenic T cells from Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG)-Induced Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice showed significantly lower levels of TSPAN32 and increased levels of CD9, CD53, CD82 and CD151. Similarly, in vitro-activated circulating CD4 T cells from MS patients showed lower levels of TSPAN32 as compared with cells from healthy donors. Overall, these data suggest an immunoregulatory role for TSPAN32 in T helper immune response and may represent a target of future immunoregulatory therapies for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.',\n",

CDR3-TCRβ repertoire sequencing in PBMC and tissue samples, along with skin-DTH score and IFN-γ ELISPOT assay, were performed to analyze the T-cell immune response dynamics throughout the immunization protocol. Histopathological analysis of the VAC-SITE revealed a highly-inflamed granulomatous structure encircled by CD11c+ nested-clusters, brisk CD8+ and scarce FOXP3+, lymphocytes with numerous Langhans multinucleated-giant-cells and macrophages. A large tumor-regression area fulfilled the C-MTS with brisk lymphocyte infiltration, mainly composed of CD8+PD1+ T-cells, CD20+ B-cells, and scarce FOXP3+ cells. Increasing DTH score and IFN-γ ELISPOT assay signal against the CSF-470 vaccine-lysate was evidenced throughout immunization. TCRβ repertoire analysis revealed for the first time the presence of common clonotypes between a VAC-SITE and a C-MTS; most of them persisted in blood by the end of the immunization protocol. In vitro boost with vaccine-lysate revealed the expansion of persistent clones that infiltrated the VAC-SITE and/or the C-MTS; other persistent clones expanded in the patient's blood as well. We propose that expansion of such persistent clonotypes might derive from two different although complementary mechanisms: the proliferation of specific clones as well as the expansion of redundant clones, which increased the number of nucleotide rearrangements per clonotype, suggesting a functional antigenic selection. In this patient, immunization with the CSF-470 vaccine plus BCG and rhGM-CSF induced a T-cell repertoire at the VAC-SITE that was able to infiltrate an emerging C-MTS, which resulted in the expansion of a T-cell repertoire that persisted in blood by the end of the 2-year treatment.\",\n",

Herein, we studied the importance of DAF in enabling processes that program tolerance in the gut and the eye, two immune-privileged sites where immunosuppressive responses are continuously elicited. Unlike oral feeding or ocular injection of ovalbumin in wild-type (WT) mice, which induced dominant immune tolerance, identical treatment of DAF-/- mice or DAF-/- to WT bone marrow chimeras did not. While 10% to 30% of mesenteric and submandibular lymph node CD4+ cells became robust T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in WT forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)-green fluorescent protein mice, few in either site became Tregs with little suppressor activity in DAF-/- Foxp3-green fluorescent protein mice. Phenotyping of CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) from the ovalbumin-fed DAF-/- mice showed impaired expression of inducer of costimulation (ICOS) ligand, programmed death receptor 1-ligand 1 (PD1-L1), CxxxC chemokine receptor 1 (Cx3CR1), CCR7, and CCR9. Analyses of elicited DAF-/- Foxp3+ Tregs showed reduced expression of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF-8)/aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A2 (Aldh1a2) and glycoprotein A repetitions predominant/latency-associated protein associated with Treg transforming growth factor-β production and presentation, as well as integrin β6/integrin β8 associated with Treg and CD103+ DC transforming growth factor-β release. Thus, DAF is required for the properties of CD103+ DCs and their naïve CD4+ cell partners that together program tolerance.',\n",

Thus, metastatic uveal melanoma remains a disease with an urgent unmet medical need. Reports of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors have thus far been disappointing. Based on animal experiments, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the effect of immunotherapy may be augmented by epigenetic therapy. Proposed mechanisms include enhanced expression of HLA class I and cancer antigens on cancer cells, as well as suppression of myeloid suppressor cells.',\n",
       " 'Merkel cell carcinoma has historically had dismal prognosis with limited cytotoxic chemotherapy options that provide durable control of metastatic disease. The advent of anti-programmed death protein (anti-PD1)/anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) directed immunotherapy has shown initial promise in Merkel cell carcinoma and radiation might augment immune responses. We present a case report of a 70-year-old male who underwent resection of Merkel cell carcinoma of the right thigh with a close margin and positive right inguinal involvement. Due to high-risk features, the patient was treated with adjuvant radiation to the right groin and with systemic carboplatin/etoposide, but developed local failure requiring salvage surgical resection. The patient then developed metastatic disease with biopsy proven retroperitoneal involvement refractory to doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. The patient was then transitioned to single-agent pembrolizumab with a partial response for 10 months until developing progressive disease involving the left inguinal and left external iliac nodal regions. The progressive left inguinal/pelvic disease was treated with conventionally fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy to a dose of 45 Gy delivered in 25 fractions. Following radiation therapy, the patient had complete response of all sites of disease throughout the body on imaging by RECIST criteria including retroperitoneal and mediastinal disease outside the radiation field. At 20 months post-radiation, the patient remains on pembrolizumab without evidence of disease on imaging. Herein, we present a case of durable response of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma treated with concurrent radiation and pembrolizumab, providing evidence that radiation might improve systemic responses to anti-PD1/PD-L1 directed immune therapy. Ongoing prospective trials evaluating the utility of radiation in conjunction with immunotherapy for Merkel cell carcinoma are anticipated to provide clarity on the frequency and durability of abscopal responses when radiation is combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.',\n",

       " 'Inhibitory/repressor-receptors are upregulated significantly on activated T cells, and have been the molecules of attention as targets for inducing immune tolerance. Induction of effective antigen specific tolerance depends on concurrent engagement of the TCR and one or more of these inhibitory receptors. Here, we show, for the first time that dendritic cells (DCs) can be efficiently engineered to express multiple T cell inhibitory ligands, and enhanced engagement of T cell inhibitory receptors, upon antigen presentation, by these DCs can induce effective CD4+ T cell tolerance and suppress autoimmunity. Compared to control DCs, antigen presentation by DCs that ectopically express CTLA4, PD1 and BTLA selective ligands (B7.1wa, PD-L1, and HVEM-CRD1 respectively) individually (mono-ligand DCs) or in combination (multi-ligand DCs) causes an inhibition of CD4+ T cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine response, as well as increase in Foxp3+ Treg frequency and immune regulatory cytokine production. Administration of self-antigen (mouse thyroglobulin; mTg) loaded multi-ligand DCs caused hyporesponsiveness to mTg challenge, suppression of autoantibody production, and amelioration of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis. Overall, this study shows that engineered DC-directed enhanced concurrent activation of multiple T cell coinhibitory pathways is an effective way to induce self-antigen specific T cell tolerance to suppress ongoing autoimmunity.',\n",

We evaluated PD‑L1 expression in 4 breast cancer cell lines in the presence of 3\\xa0types of inhibitors, as well as IFN‑γ. The expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription\\xa01 (p‑STAT1), one of the IFN‑γ signaling pathway molecules, was analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in relation to PD‑L1 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression on cancer cells and tumor‑infiltrating CD8‑positive T cells in 111\\xa0patients with stage\\xa0II/III breast cancer. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the correlation of the IFN‑γ signature with PD‑L1 expression was analyzed in breast invasive carcinoma tissues. As a result, the JAK/STAT pathway via IFN‑γ was mainly involved in PD‑L1 expression in the cell lines examined. IHC analysis revealed that the PD‑L1 and HLA class I expression levels were significantly upregulated in the p‑STAT1‑positive cases. TCGA analysis indicated that the PD‑L1 expression and IFN‑γ signature exhibited a positive correlation. On the whole, these findings suggest that PD‑L1 and HLA class\\xa0I are co‑expressed in p‑STAT1‑positive breast cancer cells induced by IFN‑γ secreted from tumor infiltrating immune cells, and that p‑STAT1 expression may be a potential biomarker for patient selection for immunotherapy with anti‑PD‑1/anti‑PD‑L1 monoclonal antibodies.',\n",

       " 'A new family of carboranyl phosphine-iminophosphorane ligands was prepared and characterized. The new ligands present a carboranyl group directly attached to the iminophosphorane nitrogen atom through a cage carbon atom (C-carboranyl derivatives L1-L3) or through the B3 boron atom (B-carboranyl derivatives L4 and L5), and the phosphine group on a side chain derived from the diphosphine dppm, i.e. with a two-atom spacer between the P and N donor atoms. The non-carboranyl analogue L6, with a biphenyl group on the nitrogen atom, was also synthesized for comparison. These potential (P, N) ligands were used to obtain palladium complexes (Pd1-Pd6) and, thus, study how the different inductive effect of the carboranyl substituents can modify the coordinating ability of the nitrogen atom. The structural analysis of the complexes revealed two different coordination modes for the ligands: the (P, N) chelate coordination and the unexpected P-terminal coordination, which is not observed for non-carboranyl phosphine-iminophosphoranes. These unexpected structural differences led us to perform DFT calculations on the ligands and metal complexes. The calculations show that the final coordination modes depend on the balance between the electronic and steric properties of the particular carboranyl group.',\n",

       " 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment has recently become a first-line therapy for many non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Unfortunately, most NSCLC patients are refractory to ICI monotherapy, and initial attempts to address this issue with secondary therapeutics have proven unsuccessful. To identify entities precluding CD8+ T cell accumulation in this process, we performed unbiased analyses on flow cytometry, gene expression, and multiplexed immunohistochemical data from a NSCLC patient cohort. The results revealed the presence of a myeloid-rich subgroup, which was devoid of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Of all myeloid cell types assessed, neutrophils were the most highly associated with the myeloid phenotype. Additionally, the ratio of CD8+ T cells to neutrophils (CD8/PMN) within the tumor mass optimally distinguished between active and myeloid cases. This ratio was also capable of showing the separation of patients responsive to ICI therapy from those with stable or progressive disease in 2 independent cohorts. Tumor-bearing mice treated with a combination of anti-PD1 and SX-682 (CXCR1/2 inhibitor) displayed relocation of lymphocytes from the tumor periphery into a malignant tumor, which was associated with induction of IFN-γ-responsive genes. These results suggest that neutrophil antagonism may represent a viable secondary therapeutic strategy to enhance ICI treatment outcomes.',\n",

       " 'Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) aims to deliver a high radiation dose to cancer cells, while minimizing the exposure of normal cells. Typically, monoclonal antibodies are used to target the radionuclides to cancer cell surface antigens. However, antibodies face limitations due to their poor tumor penetration and suboptimal pharmacokinetics, while the expression of their target on the cancer cell surface may be gradually lost. In addition, most antigens are expressed in a limited number of tumor types. To circumvent these problems, we developed a Nanobody (Nb)-based RIT against a prominent stromal cell (stromal-targeting radioimmunotherapy or STRIT) present in nearly all tumors, the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM). Macrophage Mannose Receptor (MMR) functions as a stable molecular target on TAM residing in hypoxic areas, further allowing the delivery of a high radiation dose to the more radioresistant hypoxic tumor regions. Since MMR expression is not restricted to TAM, we first optimized a strategy to block extra-tumoral MMR to prevent therapy-induced toxicity. A 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled bivalent Nb largely blocks extra-tumoral binding of 177Lu-labeled anti-MMR Nb and prevents toxicity, while still allowing the intra-tumoral binding of the monovalent Nb. Interestingly, three doses of 177Lu-labeled anti-MMR Nb resulted in a significantly retarded tumor growth, thereby outcompeting the effects of anti-PD1, anti-VEGFR2, doxorubicin and paclitaxel in the TS/A mammary carcinoma model. Together, these data propose anti-MMR STRIT as a valid new approach for cancer treatment.',\n",

We aimed to investigate the association between programmed cell death 1 polymorphism (PD1.3G/A (rs11568821) and PD1.5C/T (rs2227981)) with the risk of SLE in the Egyptian female population. This retrospective case-control study included 150 Egyptian females; 70 patients diagnosed to have SLE and 80 age-matched healthy controls. The two single nucleotide polymorphisms of the pdcd1 gene were genotyped by allelic discrimination through TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. The PD1.3GG genotype and G allele as well as the PD1.5CC genotype were significantly more frequent in SLE patients (67.1%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.023, 82.1%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0021, 62.9%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0287 respectively).

To evaluate the relative benefit in term of Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) of checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone, overall and in subgroups defined by PDL1 expression we have performed a meta-analysis. Data Sources: This meta-analysis searched PubMed and checked references of the selected English language articles to identify further eligible trials. Data collection for this study took place from October 1 to October 24, 2018. Results: In total, 8 trials involving 4,646 patients with advanced NSCLC, 3.314 (71%) and 1.332 (29%) with a non-squamous and squamous histology, respectively, were included in this meta-analysis. Four trials used atezolizumab, 3 pembrolizumab, and 1 nivolumab, accounting for 2.985 (64%), 1.298 (28%), and 363 (8%) of patients, respectively. The patients were randomized to receive first-line chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor vs. first-line chemotherapy, 2,978 patients for the OS endpoint and first-line chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor vs. first-line chemotherapy, 1,740 patients in the PFS endpoint. Checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy were associated with prolonged OS, compared with chemotherapy in the ITT population (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.87; p = 0.0002, with significant heterogeneity among trials). Notably within the PDL1 low group (1-49) there was a significant heterogeneity (p = 0.06) between type of drug and efficacy: the combination of chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab showed an OS benefit (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40-0.78; P < 0.00007) unlike the atezolizumab backbone trials (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62-1.37; P < 0.69). However, checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy were associated with prolonged PFS in the ITT (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56-0.66; P < 0.00001) and across PDL1 subgroups. Conclusion and Relevance: Checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy, are associated with significantly prolonged OS and PFS in first-line therapy in NSCLC. In the low PDL1 subgroups the benefit was statistically significant only in the pembrolizumab backbone trials. The findings of this meta-analysis could assist in the design and interpretation of future trials and in economic analyses.',\n",

In vitro, DV281 potently induced Interferon (IFN)‑α from monkey and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), stimulated interleukin‑6 production and proliferation in human B cells, and induced TLR9-dependent cytokine responses from mouse splenocytes. Intranasal delivery of DV281 to mice led to substantial but transient cytokine and chemokine responses in the lung. Lung responses to repeated intranasal DV281 were partially to fully reversible 2\\u202fweeks after the final dose and were absent in TLR9-deficient mice. Single escalating doses of aerosolized DV281 in monkeys induced dose-dependent induction of IFN-regulated genes in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and blood. In a repeat-dose safety study in monkeys, inhaled DV281 was well-tolerated, and findings were mechanism of action-related and non-adverse. Co-culture of human PBMC with DV281 and anti-PD‑1 antibody did not augment cytokine or cellular proliferation responses compared to DV281 alone, indicating that the combination did not lead to dysregulated cytokine responses. These studies support clinical development of inhaled aerosolized DV281 as a combination therapy with anti-PD‑1 antibody for lung cancer immunotherapy.',\n",

Expression of PD-L1 is also found on human tumor cells. PD-L1 as the ligand to PD1 receptor molecule of CD8+ T cells inhibits its cytotoxic effect on the tumor cell. The modern target therapy uses this interaction to inhibit the PD-1 molecule of T cells to stimulate tumor necrosis. To compare expression differences, twelve frequent types of malignant tumors with ten patients per group were selected. Immunohistochemical stains with different antibodies for PD-L1 (DAKO, Spring Bioscience, Ventana, Cell Signaling, Biocare Medical, Abcam, Zeta Corporation) were performed, analyzed and compared. To summarize, we detected variable expression pattern of PD-L1 with general higher mean value of expression of tumor cells with clone SP263 in most tumor groups. In the comparison of selected cases of lung cancer, therapy relevant differences of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells with different antibodies were observed. Additionally, the profiling study of several PD-L1-antibody clones (28-8 Abcam and 28-8 DAKO, SP142, SP263) with Signal-to-Amino Acid Residue Plots was performed with interesting findings of cross-activity of SP142 with two peptides from PD-1, which can explain why clone SP142 stains immune cells more intensively, as previously published.',\n",
       " 'Certain types of cationic lipids have shown promise in cancer immunotherapy, but their mechanism of action is poorly understood. In this study, we describe the properties of an immunotherapeutic consisting of the pure cationic lipid enantiomer R-1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethyl-ammonium-propane (R-DOTAP) formulated with modified viral or self-peptide Ags. R-DOTAP formulations with peptide Ags stimulate strong cross-presentation and potent CD8 T cell responses associated with a high frequency of polyfunctional CD8 T cells. In a human papillomavirus tumor model system, a single s.c. injection of tumor-bearing mice with R-DOTAP plus human papillomavirus Ags induces complete regression of large tumors associated with an influx of Ag-specific CD8 T cells and a reduction of the ratio of regulatory/Ag-specific CD8 T cells. R-DOTAP also synergizes with an anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, resulting in a significant inhibition of B16 melanoma tumor growth. We found that R-DOTAP stimulates type I IFN production by dendritic cells in vivo and in vitro. s.c. injection of R-DOTAP results in an IFN-dependent increase in draining lymph node size and a concomitant increase in CD69 expression. Using knockout mice, we show that type I IFN is required for the induction of CD8 T cell activity following administration of R-DOTAP plus Ag. This response requires Myd88 but not TRIF or STING. We also show that R-DOTAP stimulates both TLR7 and 9. Collectively, these studies reveal that R-DOTAP stimulates endosomal TLRs, resulting in a Myd88-dependent production of type I IFN. When administered with Ag, this results in potent Ag-specific CD8 T cell responses and antitumor activity.',\n",
       " 'A significant proportion of individuals develop chronic, persistent and recurrent genital tract infections with Chlamydia trachomatis, which has been attributed to the numerous strategies that the bacterium uses to subvert host immune responses. Animal chlamydia models have demonstrated that protective immune response is mediated by CD4+ Th1 cytokine responses. Herein, we demonstrate that early after infecting the male genital tract, C. muridarum triggers the production of IL-10 by splenic and lymph node cells. In addition, C. muridarum triggers IL-6 and TNFα secretion. Data obtained from in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed B cells as the major IL-10 contributors. Indeed, purified B cells produced high amounts of IL-10 and also exhibited enhanced expression of inhibitory molecules such as CD39, PD-L1 and PD1 after C. muridarum stimulation. In vitro experiments performed with sorted cell subsets revealed that Marginal Zone B cells were the main IL-10 producers. In vitro and in vivo studies using TLR-deficient mice indicated that TLR4 signaling pathway was essential for IL-10 production. In addition, in vivo treatments to neutralize IL-10 or deplete B cells indicated that IL-10 and B cells played a significant role in delaying bacterial clearance ability. Moreover, the latter was confirmed by adoptive cell transfer experiments in which the absence of IL-10-producing B cells conferred the host a greater capability to induce Th1 responses and clear the infection. Interestingly, NOD mice, which were the least efficient in clearing the infection, presented much more Marginal Zone B counts and also enhanced TLR4 expression on Marginal Zone B cells when compared to B6 and BALB/c mice. Besides, treatment with antibodies that selectively deplete Marginal Zone B cells rendered mice more capable of inducing enhanced IFNγ responses and clearing the infection. Our findings suggest that B cells play a detrimental role in C. muridarum infection and that activation by innate receptors like TLR4 and IL-10 production by these cells could be used by Chlamydia spp. as a strategy to modulate the immune response establishing chronic infections in susceptible hosts.',\n",

However, checkpoint immunotherapies antagonizing the suppression of these cells are ineffective in the great majority of patients. To better understand the immune cell regulation in CRC, we compared tumor-associated T lymphocytes and macrophages to the immune cell infiltrate of normal mucosa. Human colorectal tumor specimen and tumor-distant normal mucosa tissues of the same patients were collected. Phenotypes and functionality of tissue-derived T cells and macrophages were characterized using immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, and multiparameter flow cytometry. CRC contained significantly higher numbers of potentially immunosuppressive CD39 and Helios-expressing regulatory T cells in comparison to normal mucosa. Surprisingly, we found a concomitant increase of pro-inflammatory IFNγ -producing T cells. PD-L1+ stromal cells were decreased in the tumor tissue. Macrophages in the tumor compared to tumor-distant normal tissue appear to have an altered phenotype, identified by HLA-DR, CD14, CX3CR1, and CD64, and tolerogenic CD206+ macrophages are quantitatively reduced. The prognostic effect of these observed differences between distant mucosa and tumor tissue on the overall survival was examined using gene expression data of 298 CRC patients. The combined gene expression of increased FOXP3, IFNγ, CD14, and decreased CD206 correlated with a poor prognosis in CRC patients. These data reveal that the CRC microenvironment promotes the coexistence of seemingly antagonistic suppressive and pro-inflammatory immune responses and might provide an explanation why a blockade of the PD1/PD-L1 axis is ineffective in CRC. This should be taken into account when designing novel treatment strategies.',\n",

Previously, we have reported that these outcomes are associated with the impaired function of decidual Treg cells; however, the detailed mechanisms involved were unclear. It has been reported that the suppressive capacity of Treg cells is dependent on PD-1 expression. The present study explored the role of decidual PD-1+ Treg cell function in adverse pregnancy outcomes due to T. gondii infection. Toxoplasma gondii-infected pregnant mice were sacrificed on gestational day 14 and their pregnancy outcomes were observed. The expression of PD-1 on decidual Treg cells and expressions of Foxp3, CTLA-4, TGF-β, and IL-10 on decidual PD-1+ and PD-1- Treg cells were determined using flow cytometry. The results showed that the expression of PD-1 on decidual Treg cells was clearly higher in the T. gondii-infected mice than in the normal mice. Meanwhile, the expressions of Foxp3, CTLA-4, TGF-β, and IL-10 on decidual PD-1+ Treg cells were higher in the infected mice than in the normal mice. The expressions were higher in decidual PD1+ Treg cells than in PD-1- Treg cells in the infected mice. However, these expressions on PD-1- Treg cells did not significantly differ between the infected and normal mice. Nonetheless, the absolute percentages of decidual PD-1+ Treg cells decreased significantly in the infected mice compared with those in the normal mice. These results suggest that T. gondii infection mainly influences the function of decidual PD-1+ Treg cells, which would result in an insufficiently immunotolerant microenvironment and consequently in adverse pregnancy outcomes.',\n",

Currently, most CARs are not optimized for NK cells, so new NK-tailored CARs are needed. Here, a major activating receptor of NK cells, NKG2D was harnessed to design different chimeric receptors that mediate strong NK cell signaling. In these NKG2D signaling-based chimeric receptors, the extracellular domain of inhibitory receptor PD-1 was employed to reverse the immune escape mediated by PD-1 ligands in the solid tumors. To achieve the rational design of chimeric PD1-NKG2D receptors, we developed a transmembrane protein tertiary structure prediction program (PredMP & I-TASSER) and optimized the conformation of the PD-1 ectodomain by genetically altering the sequences encoding the hinge and intracellular domain. Finally, we identified a chimeric PD1-NKG2D receptor containing NKG2D hinge region and 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain to exhibit stable surface expression and mediate in vitro cytotoxicity of NK92 cells against various tumor cells. This strategy now provides a promising approach for the computer-aided design (CAD) of potent NK cell-tailored chimeric receptors with NKG2D signaling.',\n",

However, the majority of patients do not benefit from checkpoint therapy emphasizing the need for alternative therapeutic options. Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 (LAG3) or CD223 is expressed on multiple cell types including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and Tregs, and is required for optimal T cell regulation and homeostasis. Persistent antigen-stimulation in cancer or chronic infection leads to chronic LAG3 expression, promoting T cell exhaustion. Targeting LAG3 along with PD1 facilitates T cell reinvigoration. A substantial amount of pre-clinical data and mechanistic analysis has led to LAG3 being the third checkpoint to be targeted in the clinic with nearly a dozen therapeutics under investigation. In this review, we will discuss the structure, function and role of LAG3 in murine and human models of disease, including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, chronic viral and parasitic infections, and cancer, emphasizing new advances in the development of LAG3-targeting immunotherapies for cancer that are currently in clinical trials.',\n",

We hypothesized that tolerance may also be broken to autoantigens, resulting in autoantibody formation, which could be associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and antitumor efficacy. Twenty-three common clinical autoantibodies in pre- and posttreatment sera from 133 ipilimumab-treated melanoma patients were determined, and their development linked to the occurrence of irAEs, best overall response, and survival. Autoantibodies developed in 19.2% (19/99) of patients who were autoantibody-negative pretreatment. A nonsignificant association was observed between development of any autoantibodies and any irAEs [OR, 2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-10.01]. Patients with antithyroid antibodies after ipilimumab had significantly more thyroid dysfunction under subsequent anti-PD-1 therapy: 7/11 (54.6%) patients with antithyroid antibodies after ipilimumab developed thyroid dysfunction under anti-PD1 versus 7/49 (14.3%) patients without antibodies (OR, 9.96; 95% CI, 1.94-51.1). Patients who developed autoantibodies showed a trend for better survival (HR for all-cause death: 0.66; 95% CI, 0.34-1.26) and therapy response (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 0.85-8.16). We conclude that autoantibodies develop under ipilimumab treatment and could be a potential marker of ICI toxicity and efficacy.',\n",

       " 'Reactivation of the BK polyomavirus is known to lead to severe complications in kidney transplant patients. The current treatment strategy relies on decreasing the immunosuppression to allow the immune system to clear the virus. Recently, we demonstrated a clear association between the resolution of BKV reactivation and reconstitution of BKV-specific CD4+ T-cells. However, which factors determine the duration of viral infection clearance remains so far unclear. Here we apply a combination of in-depth multi-parametric flow cytometry and NGS-based CDR3 beta chain receptor repertoire analysis of BKV-specific T-cells to a cohort of 7 kidney transplant patients during the clinical course of BKV reactivation. This way we followed TCR repertoires at single clone levels and functional activity of BKV-specific T-cells during the resolution of BKV infection. The duration of BKV clearance did not depend on the number of peripheral blood BKV-specific T-cells nor on a few immunodominant BKV-specific T-cell clones. Rather, the T-cell receptor repertoire diversity and exhaustion status of BKV-specific T-cells affected the duration of viral clearance: high clonotype diversity and lack of PD1 and TIM3 exhaustion markers on BKV-specific T-cells was associated with short clearance time. Our data thus demonstrate how the diversity and the exhaustion state of the T-cells can determine the clinical course of BKV infection.',\n",

       " \"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease that develops as a consequence of macrophage- and T cell-dependent pancreatic β-cell death. Multiple approaches for induction of anti-inflammatory/regulatory mechanisms that would attenuate T1D have been utilized, with little or no beneficial effects. To achieve prolonged stimulation of regulatory immune cells, we orally introduced microparticles (MPs) loaded with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) to C57BL/6 mice treated with multiple low doses of streptozotocin (MLDS) for T1D induction. Disease incidence was significantly lower in ATRA/TGF-β MPs-treated mice, as was the degree of immune cell infiltration into the pancreatic islets. In Peyer's patches (PP), ATRA/TGF-β MPs up-regulated tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) (CD11c+CD11b-CD103+), while the proportion of mature dendritic cells was not altered. This was accompanied by reduced Th1 and Th17 proportions and up-regulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs - CD4+CD25highFoxP3+). The immune cell composition in the pancreatic lymph nodes was similar to PP. Further, the proportion of effector Tbet+CD25med cells was decreased, while the proportion of Tbet+ Treg cells that specifically inhibit Th1 response was increased. Moreover, ATRA/TGF-β MPs treatment resulted in increased Treg proliferation and frequency of CTLA-4+PD1+ and CD39+IL-10+ Tregs, suggestive of their higher suppressive capacity. Reduced pancreatic infiltration may have been a consequence of lower cell capacity for matrix degradation. In conclusion, oral application of ATRA/TGF-β MPs ameliorated T1D through potentiation of tolDCs and Tregs, inhibition of Th1 response and prevention of the immune cell entrance into the islets.\",\n",
       " 'Introduction: Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of cancer. Given this growing success, at the same time, there are significant limitations and unanswered questions concerning response rates, duration of therapy, why some patients respond and others do not, and if combining different immune-agents would overcome this lack of response, increase the chance of success and postpone acquired resistance. Areas covered: The comprehension of how to properly modulate the immune pathways, the molecular and the immunological bases of the disease, will be fundamental to guide the development of therapeutic interventions and combinations that will be more suitable for treatment of cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the strategies of immunotherapy combinations in order to develop more effective immunotherapy programs, with a particular focus on melanoma and renal cancer patients, as well as the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Expert Opinion: Given the complexity of immune activation, combinatorial approaches are needed, and due to the considerable variability in tumor biology across patients and tumor types, patient selection and biomarkers need to be further explored. In summary, combined therapies have shown promising success, but additional and continuous research to identify the safety, efficacy, optimal combination, dosage and timing are still required.',\n",

       " 'Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSAs) are a major risk factor associated with renal allograft outcomes. As a trigger of B cell antibody production, T follicular helper cells (Tfhs) promote DSA appearance. Herein, we evaluated whether circulating Tfhs (cTfhs) are associated with the genesis of antibody-mediated rejection. We measured cTfh levels on the day of transplantation and 1 year after transplantation in blood from a prospective cohort of 237 renal transplantation patients without DSA during the first year post-transplantation. Total cTfhs were characterized as CD4+CD45RA-CXCR5+, and the three following subsets of activated cTfh were analyzed: CXCR5+PD1+, CXCR5+PD1+ICOS+, an CXCR5+PD1+CXCR3-. Immunizing events (previous blood transfusion and/or pregnancy) and the presence of class II anti-HLA antibodies were associated with increased frequencies of activated CXCR5+PD1+, CXCR5+PD1+ICOS+, and CXCR5+PD1+CXCR3- cTfh subsets. In addition, ATG-depleting induction and calcineurin inhibitor treatments were associated with a relative increase of activated cTfh subsets frequencies at 1 year post-transplantation. In multivariate survival analysis, we reported that a decrease in activated CXCR5+PD1+ICOS+ at 1 year after transplantation in the blood of DSA-free patients was significantly associated with the risk of developing de novo DSA after the first year (p = 0.018, HR = 0.39), independently of HLA mismatches (p = 0.003, HR = 3.79). These results highlight the importance of monitoring activated Tfhs in patients early after transplantation and show that current treatments cannot provide early, efficient prevention of Tfh activation and migration. These findings indicate the need to develop innovative treatments to specifically target Tfhs to prevent DSA appearance in renal transplantation.',\n",

       " 'Histological regression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes represent an early sign of activation of the immune system against primary melanoma. The first phenomenon has been especially discussed in the literature because of its prognostic role, but no clear agreement on its evaluation has been reached. Immunotherapy of advanced stage melanoma has recently shown promising results; an improved understanding of the initial interplay between melanoma cells and the immune system would potentially help tailor treatment for patients. Seventy consecutive melanomas with regression were analysed to identify a prognostic cut-off value of regression extension. Then, we compared the immune infiltrate between regressed and not regressed areas of these regressed melanomas, assessing CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD123, PD1 and FOXP3/CD25 expression. The immune infiltrate of these cases was further compared with 28 control melanomas without regression. A regression extension of 10% represented a reliable cut-off to distinguish two different risk categories in regressed melanomas. Regressed areas were less infiltrated by CD4/CD25, FOXP3/CD4 or PD1/CD4 compared to not regressed areas of each sample. These lymphocyte subsets are associated with anergy and hamper the immune CD8+ response towards the cancer cells. Moreover, the relevance of these findings was further supported by the observation that not regressed controls were significantly more infiltrated by these anergic immune cell subsets compared to the regressed cases. These results help understand the real meaning of regression in melanoma. Moreover, the association here identified between specific immunomodulatory immune cell subsets and regression could help in developing new therapeutic strategies.',\n",

We used multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to study the immune contexture in adult precursor B cell ALL bone marrow (BM).

We analyzed BM biopsy samples of ALL patients (n\\u2009=\\u200952) and healthy controls (n\\u2009=\\u200914) using mIHC with 30 different immunophenotype markers and computerized image analysis. In ALL BM, the proportions of M1-like macrophages, granzyme B+CD57+CD8+ T cells, and CD27+ T cells were decreased, whereas the proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and M2-like macrophages were increased. Also, the expression of checkpoint molecules PD1 and CTLA4 was elevated. In the multivariate model, age, platelet count, and the proportion of PD1+TIM3+ double-positive CD4+ T cells differentiated a poor survival group. These results were validated by flow cytometry in a separate cohort (n\\u2009=\\u200931). In conclusion, the immune cell contexture in ALL BM differs from healthy controls. CD4+PD1+TIM3+ T cells were independent predictors of poor outcome in our multivariate risk model, suggesting that PD1 might serve as an attractive immuno-oncological target in B-ALL.',\n",

       " 'Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) is a variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma arising within seroma effusion associated with breast implants. BI-ALCL is a rare disease, recently recognized as a new provisional entity by the 2017 revised World Health Organization classification. All BI-ALCLs tested so far showed a \"triple-negative\" genetic profile-negative for ALK, DUSP22, and TP63 rearrangements-and were characterized by mutational and gene expression profiles consistent with aberrant activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. The active form of STAT3 (pSTAT3) is constantly expressed in BI-ALCLs and may favor tumor immune escape by triggering the transcription of PDL1 (CD274), a gene encoding the immune-checkpoint molecule programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1); immunohistochemical positivity for PDL1 has been recently described in 3 BI-ALCL cases, and one of them also harbored PDL1 gene amplification. We evaluated PDL1 and pSTAT expression by immunohistochemistry and PDL1 copy number alterations (CNAs) at chromosome 9p24.1 by fluorescent in situ hybridization in a cohort of 9 BI-ALCL cases; we also investigated the presence of tumor-infiltrating programmed cell death 1 (PD1)+ T cells (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs) and PDL1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in BI-ALCL microenvironment. Tumor cells expressed PDL1 in 5 (56%) of 9 cases and harbored PDL1 CNAs in 3 (33%) of 9 cases; immunohistochemistry for pSTAT3 was positive in all 6 cases tested (100%), indicative of active JAK/STAT signaling. We observed PDL1 CNAs only among PDL1-positive cases, whereas PD1+ TILs and PDL1+ TAMs were present at variable levels in both PDL1-positive and PDL1-negative BI-ALCLs. We report frequent PDL1 expression and recurrent PDL1 CNAs in BI-ALCLs: our data suggest that 9p24.1 alterations represent a common mechanism of PDL1 overexpression in this disease, likely acting in synergy with constitutive pSTAT3 signaling. In PDL1-positive cases without chromosomal aberration, PDL1 expression may be induced by JAK/STAT signaling alone and/or others alternative pathways. BI-ALCL microenvironment hosts variable amounts of PD1+ TILs and PDL1+ TAMs, suggesting the presence of an active PD1/PDL1 axis. These findings may be of therapeutic value in advanced-stage patients who may benefit from a PD1/PDL1 blocking treatment.',\n",

       " 'Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) can facilitate immune evasion by tumor cells by dampening anti-tumor immunity. Reduced Teff/Treg ratio and enhanced Treg functional activity have been observed in patients suffering from different types of cancers, and attenuated Treg numbers/functions can serve as prognostic indicators. Normally, Tregs play an essential role in the maintenance of immune tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity. The most common immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) targeting co-inhibitory receptors such as anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab and tremelimumab) and anti-PD1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab)/anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab) have achieved unprecedented success in cancer treatment by facilitating an effective anti-tumor immune response, at least in part, by blocking Treg mediated immunosuppression. While ICBs have shown remarkable success in cancer immunotherapy, immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) arising from ICB have forced consideration of ways to maintain immune homeostasis post ICB treatment. Preclinical models of IRAEs have shown a negative correlation between Treg numbers and IRAEs. Therefore, understanding the \"ying-yang\" role of Tregs in the regulation of autoimmunity and anti-tumor immunity is critical to provoking an effective anti-tumor response while maintaining immune homeostasis. Studies aimed at developing effective approaches to minimize IRAEs without compromising anti-tumor immunity are underway. Herein, we discuss 1) the critical role of key co-inhibitory receptors on Treg homeostasis and tumor tolerance; 2) how co-receptor blockade by cancer immunotherapy can lead to autoimmune adverse events; and 3) recently emerging management strategies to minimize autoimmune adverse events arising from ICB.',\n",
       " 'Male rats rarely show lordosis, a female sexual behavior, because of strong inhibition of the behavior in the lateral septum. Because neonatal treatment with estradiol (E2) in female rats decreases lordosis, it is believed that the lateral septum is a target of E2 action to defeminize or masculinize the lordosis-inhibiting system. Here, we tested the hypothesis that disruption of the lateral septum before E2 treatment prevents the effect of neonatal E2 on lordosis. Female rats that underwent radiofrequency-induced septal lesions or sham operation on postnatal day 4 (PD4, day of birth\\u2009=\\u2009PD1) were subcutaneously injected with E2 or sesame oil vehicle alone on PD5. Vaginal opening and smears were checked. After sexual maturation, lordosis tests were performed. The effects of neonatal septal lesions on lordosis in male rats were also observed. Sham-operated and E2-treated female rats showed a reduction in lordosis and irregular estrous cycles. Conversely, septal lesioned and E2-treated females exhibited higher levels of lordosis, although their estrous cycles were irregular. These results suggest that neonatal septal lesions prevent females from being behaviorally defeminized by neonatal E2. Additionally, neonatally septal lesioned males displayed higher levels of lordosis than sham-operated males. These results suggest that E2, which is produced by the aromatization of testicular testosterone in the neonatal period, acts on the lateral septum to organize the lordosis-inhibiting system.',\n",

In this study, we aimed to characterize the changes in tumor-infiltrating immune cells and checkpoint molecules following NACT and investigate the prognostic value of these changes in LAGC. Paired tumor samples (pre-NACT and post-NACT) of 60 patients were retrospectively identified and analyzed by multiplex immunohistochemistry with a panel including CD4, CD8, FOXP3, PD-1, PD-L1, and TIM3. Following NACT, the overall median expression levels of CD4, CD8, PD1, PD-L1 and TIM3 were significantly increased (P = 0.008 for PD-L1 and P < 0.001 for all the other markers), while the median FOXP3 expression level remained stable (P = 0.120). Individually, the majority of patients presented increased expression of the markers, while 8.5%, 11.9%, 16.9%, 25.4%, 22.0% and 42.2% of patients had decreased expression of CD4, CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3 and FOXP3, respectively. Changes in expression between baseline and post-NACT of TIM3, PD-1, and PD-L1 showed strongly positive pairwise correlations with each other (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high upregulation levels of CD8 (HR = 0.73, P = 0.028), PD-1 (HR = 0.76, P = 0.027), and PD-L1 (HR = 0.67, P = 0.038) following NACT were beneficial prognostic factors of OS.

Mechanistically, the anthracycline component of the novel ADC induced immunogenic cell death leading to exposure and secretion of danger-associated molecular signals. RNA sequencing derived immunogenomic signatures and TCRβ clonotype analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed a prominent role of the adaptive immune system in the regulation of T-PNU mediated anti-cancer activity. Depletion of CD8 T cells severely reduced T-PNU efficacy, thus confirming the role of cytotoxic T cells as drivers of the T-PNU mediated anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, T-PNU therapy promoted immunological memory formation in tumor-bearing animals protecting those from tumor rechallenge. Finally, the combination of T-PNU and checkpoint inhibition, such as α-PD1, significantly enhanced tumor eradication following the treatment. In summary, a novel PNU-armed, HER2-targeting ADC elicited long-lasting immune protection in a murine orthotopic breast cancer model resistant to other HER2-directed therapies. Our findings delineate the therapeutic potential of this novel ADC payload and support its clinical development for breast cancer patients and potentially other HER2 expressing malignancies.',\n",

In scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it exhibits a unique surface morphology resembling the famous Weaire-Phelan bubble structure of the Olympic \"WaterCube\" in Beijing. The \"soap bubbles\" of this \"Nano WaterCube\" are adjustable with their average sizes (in-between 15 and 80 nm) related to the Pb concentration (x < 0.2) dependence of the lattice parameter of the Pd1- x Pbx (111) alloy surface. Angle-resolved core-level measurements demonstrate that a lead sheet overlays the Pd1- x Pbx (111) alloy.

       " \"Protective T cell responses against tumors require the production of Interferon gamma (IFN-γ). However, tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) gradually lose their capacity to produce IFN-γ and therefore fail to clear malignant cells. Dissecting the underlying mechanisms that block cytokine production is thus key for improving T cell products. Here we show that although TILs express substantial levels of Ifng mRNA, post-transcriptional mechanisms impede the production of IFN-γ protein due to loss of mRNA stability. CD28 triggering, but not PD1 blocking antibodies, effectively restores the stability of Ifng mRNA. Intriguingly, TILs devoid of AU-rich elements within the 3'untranslated region maintain stabilized Ifng mRNA and produce more IFN-γ protein than wild-type TILs. This sustained IFN-γ production translates into effective suppression of tumor outgrowth, which is almost exclusively mediated by direct effects on the tumor cells. We therefore conclude that post-transcriptional mechanisms could be modulated to potentiate effective T cell therapies in cancer.\",\n",

However, no reports addressing alteration of PD-L1 expression after ICI therapy in NSCLC are available so far. The patients were Japanese males 83 and 87 years old, who were diagnosed with NSCLC based on the transbronchial lung biopsies showing sarcomatoid feature with high PD-L1 expression.

This alteration was less prominent in the perinecrotic tumor area. A considerable decrease of PD-L1 score was linked with a little effect of Pembrolizumab in our patients. This association might be one of the contributing mechanisms of resistance to ICI and needs further investigation in large-scale studies.',\n",

       " 'Previous studies suggest that radiotherapy (RT) can induce immune activation, which not only reduces the progression of tumors, but also causes the release of tumor antigens. The combination of RT and immune checkpoint blockade, such as the inhibition of programmed cell death 1 (PD‑1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‑L1), has been demonstrated to yield impressive response rates. However, a substantial proportion of patients develop resistance such therapies. Previous studies have shown that indoleamine 2,3‑dioxygenase (IDO) causes T cell exhaustion and increased formation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), upregulating the expression of inhibitory receptors and ligands. Therefore, the application of IDO inhibitors combined with RT may have a synergistic effect by relieving immunosuppression. Lewis lung cancer cell‑bearing mice were treated with the IDO inhibitor 1‑methyl‑tryptophan (1MT) and/or 10\\xa0Gy RT. Tumor size was measured every day, flow cytometry was performed to measure the expression of dendritic cell (DC) maturation markers, inhibitory receptors, ligands, cytotoxic T cells and Treg phenotypic markers. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of IDO, PD‑L1, PD‑1, T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM‑3), B‑ and T‑lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and galectin‑9. Compared with the control group, treatment with 1MT or RT reduced tumor growth, however, the combination therapy was more effective than either treatment alone. Flow cytometry showed the upregulation of CD80, CD86 and the major histocompatibility complex II in spleen DCs and the concurrent downregulation of CD4, CD25 and forkhead box protein P3 in lymphocytes in the treatment groups. Compared with the control group, inhibitory receptors and ligands that affect DCs and T cells were observed, expression levels of PD‑L1, PD‑1, TIM‑3, BTLA and galectin‑9 are decreased in treatment group compared with control.

Modern immunotherapy strategies augment the immune system and ideally, permit durable tumor-specific immune memory. In fact, several monoclonal antibodies that mediate the immune checkpoint receptors have provided the most clinically meaningful improvement for breast cancer patients to date, particularly for the triple negative subtype. Checkpoint blockade as monotherapy has demonstrated some encouraging results, although some combination strategies appear to augment those responses and may be particularly effective when administered earlier in the course of disease. For example, the combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy for metastatic triple negative breast cancer demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy alone.

       " 'Interferon-gamma (IFNG) augments immune function yet promotes T\\xa0cell exhaustion through PDL1. How these opposing effects are integrated to impact immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is unclear. We show that while inhibiting tumor IFNG signaling decreases interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in cancer cells, it increases ISGs in immune cells by enhancing IFNG produced by exhausted T\\xa0cells (TEX). In tumors with favorable antigenicity, these TEX mediate rejection. In tumors with neoantigen or MHC-I loss, TEX instead utilize IFNG to drive maturation of innate immune cells, including a PD1+TRAIL+ ILC1 population. By disabling an inhibitory circuit impacting PD1 and TRAIL, blocking tumor IFNG signaling promotes innate immune killing. Thus, interferon signaling in cancer cells and immune cells oppose each other to establish a regulatory relationship that limits both adaptive and innate immune killing. In melanoma and lung cancer patients, perturbation of this relationship is associated with ICB response independent of tumor mutational burden.',\n",

Strategies to improve the disease control rate are needed. Several reports suggested that debulking surgery enhances anti-tumor immunity. We aimed at examining tumor burden as a predictive factor of anti-PD1 tretment efficacy and to evaluate the role of cytoreductive surgery in anti-PD1 treated NSCLC. Immunocompetent DBA/2 mice engrafted with various amount of allogeneic lung squamous cancer KLN-205 cells were treated with anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody. Mice engrafted with two tumors also underwent a debulking surgery or a sham procedure. Tumor volume was monitored to assess treatment efficacy. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were assessed by flow cytometry. In a retrospective study of 48 stage IV NSCLC patients treated with Nivolumab who underwent a 18-FDG PETscan before treatment onset, the prognostic role of metabolic tumor volume was analysed. Anti-PD1 treatment effect was greater in mice bearing smaller tumors. Treatment with higher doses of anti-PD1 antibody did not improve the outcome, independently of the size of the tumor. In mice bearing 2 tumors, excision of 1 tumor improved the anti-PD1 treatment effect on the remaining tumor. In 48 NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD1 treatment, high metabolic tumor volume was associated with poor overall survival and the absence of clinical benefit. Treg infiltration, but not effector T cells, was positively correlated to tumor volume. Taken together, our results suggest that tumor volume is a predictive factor of anti-PD1 efficacy in NSCLC. Additionally, an experimental murine model suggests that tumor debulking may improve control of residual tumor.',\n",

Because of this, detailed and accurate assessment of the tumor immune microenvironment is paramount. In this study, we aimed to correlate the composition of the tumor immune microenvironment with oncologic outcome and the expression of two cancer testis antigens (CTAs), CT10 and PRAME, potential cancer vaccine targets, as well as major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I), a molecule associated with tumor immune escape and resistance to immunotherapy. Triplicate tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed using 207 cases of HGUC of the bladder. Oncologic outcome data was gathered for each case. Consecutive sections from the TMA blocks were stained with CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, PD1, PD-L1, CT10, PRAME, and MHC I. Twenty-one percent and 15% of cases expressed CT10 and PRAME, respectively.

We present the unique case of a patient that developed an invasive NPM while under treatment with a combination of vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and atezolizumab. A 39-year-old white male was treated with vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and atezolizumab for a stage IV (T0, N3, M1) BRAF-V600E mutated malignant melanoma in the context of a clinical trial. Eight months from treatment initiation he was diagnosed with an NPM on his back that was found to be BRAF-wild type and neuroblastoma ras mutated, while he was in complete remission. Wide excision of the lesion followed, and the patient was not withdrawn from study treatment. Twenty-two months from treatment initiation, he is still in complete remission. NPMs are a well-known adverse effect of BRAF inhibitors and pose a challenge for the treating physician since these lesions are BRAF-wild type and usually have aggressive biologic behaviour. Invasive NPMs require an aggressive management strategy with clear guidelines to prevent the emergence of advanced or metastatic disease. The emergence of invasive NPMs in patients treated with triple regimens with BRAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors and PD1/PDL1 inhibitors is at least unexpected and constitutes a therapeutic stalemate for the physician.

If these results are generalizable to an unselected patient population treated in clinical routine is unknown. This study aimed to investigate and describe clinical efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors in patients with MM treated in routine clinical practice. Material and methods: A retrospective descriptive study of patients with metastatic or inoperable cutaneous melanoma treated with PD-1 inhibitors at a single institution (Department of Oncology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital) from 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2017. Data were obtained from medical records. Results: A total of 116 patients were included in the analyses. The overall survival (OS) at 12-month follow-up was 70.2% and the median OS was 27.9\\xa0months. Patients with BRAF mutated tumors had increased OS, whereas ECOG PS ≥2, LDH\\u2009>\\u2009ULN and presence or history of brain metastases (stage M1d) were associated with impaired survival. Immune-related AEs of any grade occurred in 64 (55.2%) patients and 15 (12.9%) patients experienced immune-related AEs of grades 3 and 4. Notably, rheumatic adverse events occurred at a higher rate (15.5%) than previously reported. The occurrence of immune-related AEs was associated with a benefit in OS, while the severity of immune-related AEs did not affect survival, nor did the use of systemic corticosteroids. Conclusions: The efficacy and safety of PD1 inhibitors in routine clinical practice appear comparable to that described in clinical trials.',\n",
       " 'Radiotherapy (RT), the major anti-cancer modality for more than half of cancer patients after diagnosis, has the advantage of local tumor control with relatively less systematic side effects comparing to chemotherapy. However, the efficacy of RT is limited by acquired tumor resistance leading to the risks of relapse and metastasis. To further enhance the efficacy of RT, with the renaissances of targeted immunotherapy (TIT), increasing interests are raised on RT combined with TIT including cancer vaccines, T-cell therapy, and antibody-based immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1/PD-L1. In achieving a significant synergy between RT and TIT, the dynamics of radiation-induced response in tumor cells and stromal cells, especially the cross-talk between tumor cells and immune cells in the irradiated tumor microenvironment (ITME) as highlighted in recent literature are to be elucidated. The abscopal effect refereeing the RT-induced priming function outside of ITME could be compromised by the immune-suppressive factors such as CD47 and PD-L1 on tumor cells and Treg induced or enhanced in the ITME. Cell surface receptors temporally or permanently induced and bioactive elements released from dead cells could serve antigenic source (radiation-associated antigenic proteins, RAAPs) to the host and have functions in immune regulation on the tumor. This review is attempted to summarize a cluster of factors that are inducible by radiation and targetable by antibodies, or have potential to be immune regulators to synergize tumor control with RT. Further characterization of immune regulators in ITME will deepen our understanding of the interplay among immune regulators in ITME and discover new effective targets for the combined modality with RT and TIT.',\n",
       " 'Genetically engineered T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) are rapidly emerging a promising new treatment for haematological and non-haematological malignancies. CAR-T therapy can induce rapid and durable clinical responses but is associated with unique acute toxicities. Moreover, CAR-T cells are vulnerable to immunosuppressive mechanisms. Here, we report that CAR-T cells release extracellular vesicles, mostly in the form of exosomes that carry CAR on their surface. The CAR-containing exosomes express a high level of cytotoxic molecules and inhibit tumour growth. Compared with CAR-T cells, CAR exosomes do not express Programmed cell Death protein 1 (PD1), and their antitumour effect cannot be weakened by recombinant PD-L1 treatment. In a preclinical in vivo model of cytokine release syndrome, the administration of CAR exosomes is relatively safe compared with CAR-T therapy. This study supports the use of exosomes as biomimetic nanovesicles that may be useful in future therapeutic approaches against tumours.',\n",
       " 'Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable malignancy involving lymph nodes and the lymphatic system. Even at late stage disease, about 70% of patients will be cured with standard first line therapy. For patients who experience relapse or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the standard treatment option is high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplant. However about 50% of patients will have recurrence after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation and have worse prognosis with median overall survival of 32% at 5 years. The anti-PD1 checkpoints inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab have remarkably improved outcomes of patients with relapse of refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation. On the other hand, radiotherapy is an entire component of salvage therapy and its efficacy is now well established in term of local disease control in sites of relapsed or refractory Hodkin lymphoma. Defining the optimal modality and timing of radiotherapy as these new agents arrive is a challenge. An interesting approach is the combination of radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor and the possibility of stopping the treatment when complete response is achieved. We add to the literature two new cases of combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy in patients who relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation and consolidation with brentuximab vedotin, resulting in excellent outcomes.',\n",

In our recent case of a 52-year-old female doctor suffering from breast cancer having metastasized to the lung and liver, it was decided to use nivolumab to prevent the disease progressing after excisional surgeries and multiple chemotherapies. One month after completing the nivolumab course, fatigue, hypoglycemia and hypotension developed and isolated ACTH deficiency (IAD) was diagnosed. A further month later, under steroid supplementation, hyperglycemia emerged alongside thirst and polydipsia, prompting a diagnosis of fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1D). Her susceptibility to type 1 diabetes was examined by HLA haplotype and CTLA4 gene polymorphism analyses. Polymorphisms CT60G>A and +49G>A in CTLA4 both generated a GG genotype. Our patient manifested one of the rarest combinations of autoimmune disease induced by nivolumab. Whereas the HLA haplotype was unsusceptible to autoimmune type 1 diabetes, polymorphisms of CTLA4, the antibody of which frequently causes hypophysitis, were susceptible to FT1D. Peripheral modulation of activated T cells, mainly by PD-1 antibodies, induced FT1D associated with IAD in patients with CTLA4 polymorphism. This case reveals hints of the T-cell etiology in T1D and evidence of CTLA4 involvement in IAD.',\n",

PD1 and CTLA4 are dynamically expressed on different T cell subsets that can either disrupt or sustain tumor growth. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against PD1/PDL1 and CTLA4 have shown that inhibitory signals can be impaired, blocking T cell activation and function. MoAbs, used as both single-agents or in combination with standard therapy for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), have exhibited advantages in terms of overall survival and response rate; nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and more recently, durvalumab, have already been approved for lung cancer treatment and more compounds are in the pipeline. A better understanding of signaling elicited by these antibodies on T cell subsets, as well as identification of biological determinants of sensitivity, resistance and correlates of efficacy, will help to define the mechanisms of antitumor responses. In addition, the relevance of T regulatory cells (Treg) involved in immune responses in cancer is attracting increasing interest. A major challenge for future research is to understand why a durable response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) occurs only in subsets of patients and the mechanisms of resistance after an initial response.

Two of these phase III randomized trials showed that the anti-PD1 antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab were superior to investigators' choice chemotherapy in second-line platinum-refractory R/M HNSCC. Recently, a third phase III randomized trial, KEYNOTE-048, showed that pembrolizumab with chemotherapy was superior to the EXTREME regimen (cis- or carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cetuximab) in all patients, and pembrolizumab monotherapy was superior in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in first-line R/M HNSCC. Pembrolizumab is now approved as monotherapy in PD-L1 expressing disease (combined positive score ≥1) or in combination with chemotherapy for all patients with R/M HNSCC. Thus, PD-L1 biomarker testing will be routinely used in R/M HNSCC, and this employs a scoring system that incorporates immune cell staining, referred to as the combined positive score (CPS). Additionally, for the 85% of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1, clinical judgment will guide the choice of pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, until more detailed clinical data are forthcoming to better inform this decision.

Checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated durable anti-tumor efficacy in human and preclinical models. Liver toxicity is one of the common immune-related adverse events associated with checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) and its frequency and severity often increase significantly during CPI combination therapies.

In contrast, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors results in a lower responses rate, but the responses tend to be more durable. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that HPV16 E6/E7-targeted therapy may synergize with the PD-1 pathway blockade to enhance antitumor activity. To test hypothesis, we described for the first time the effects of the CRISPR/Cas9 that was targeted to the HPV and PD1 in vitro and in vivo. Our data showed that gRNA/cas9 targeted HPV16 E6/E7 induced cervical cancer cell SiHa apoptosis, and suggested that overexpression of PD-L1, induced by HPV16 E6/E7, may be responsible for lymphocyte dysfunction. In established SiHa cell- xenografted humanized SCID mice, Administration of gRNA-PD-1 together with gRNA-HPV16 E6/E7 treatment improved the survival and suppressed the tumor growth obviously. In addition, combination treatment increased the population of dendritic cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocyte cells. According, it enhanced the expression of Th1-associated immune-stimulating genes while reducing the transcription of regulatory/suppressive immune genes, reshaping tumor microenvironment from an immunosuppressive to a stimulatory state.

       " 'Recent clinical data has shown that some cancers choose to express PDL2 compared to PDL1. Therefore, a detailed and comparative study of the dynamic binding mechanism between PD1/PDL1 and PD1/PDL2 can guide drug design towards PD1. Herein, long time-scale classical molecular dynamics simulation, binding free energy calculation, energy decomposition and homology modeling for PD1/PDL2 were used to shed light on the differences in the binding mechanisms of the PD1/PDL1 and PD1/PDL2 complexes. On one hand, our results reveal a different binding mechanism of PD1 binding to PDL1 and PDL2, which is mainly attributed to the induced-fit from different proteins, that is, the C\\'D loop of PD1 is essential for PD1/PDL1, while the CD loop of PDL2 is critical for PD1/PDL2. Particularly, the \"enclosed\" conformation of PDL2 leads to a higher affinity between PD1-PDL2 in comparison to the affinity between PD1-PDL1. For PD1/PDL1, the key residues of N66, Y68, Q75, T76, K78, D85, I126, L128, A132, I134 and E136 are the dominant residues for stabilizing the protein-protein interaction (PPI).

       " 'Checkpoint blockade antibodies have been approved as immunotherapy for multiple types of cancer, but the response rate and efficacy are still limited. There are few immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing drugs available that can kill cancer cells, enhance tumor immunogenicity, increase the in vivo immune infiltration, and thereby boosting a tumor response to immunotherapy. So far, the ICD markers have been identified as the few immuno-stimulating characteristics of dead cells, but whether the presence of such ICD markers on tumor cells translates into enhanced antitumor immunity in vivo is still investigational. To identify anticancer drugs that could induce tumor cell death and boost T cell response, we performed drug screenings based on both an ICD reporter assay and T cell activation assay. We identified that teniposide, a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, could induce high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release and type I interferon signaling in tumor cells, and teniposide-treated tumor cells could activate antitumor T cell response both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, teniposide induced tumor cell DNA damage and innate immune signaling including NF-κB activation and STING-dependent type I interferon signaling, both of which contribute to the activation of dendritic cells and subsequent T cells. Furthermore, teniposide potentiated the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD1 on multiple types of mouse tumor models. Our findings showed that teniposide could trigger tumor immunogenicity, and enabled a potential chemo-immunotherapeutic approach to potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy.',\n",

Aged mice developed a peripheral Tfh-like lymphoma that recapitulated key molecular, pathological, and immunophenotypic features of human angioimmunoblastic T\\xa0cell lymphoma (AITL). GAPDH induced non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation in mouse T\\xa0cells, which was strongly activated in human AITL. We developed a NIK inhibitor to reveal that targeting the NF-κB pathway prolonged AITL-bearing mouse survival alone and in combination with anti-PD-1. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting NF-κB signaling in AITL and provide a model for future AITL therapeutic investigations.',\n",

       " 'Herein, we report a novel carbothermal welding strategy to prepare atomically dispersed Pd sites anchored on a three-dimensional (3D) ZrO2 nanonet (Pd1@ZrO2) via two-step pyrolysis, which were evolved from isolated Pd sites anchored on linker-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (Pd1@NC/ZrO2). First, the NH2-H2BDC linkers and Zr6-based [Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4]12+ nodes of UiO-66-NH2 were transformed into amorphous N-doped carbon skeletons (NC) and ZrO2 nanoclusters under an argon atmosphere, respectively. The NC supports can simultaneously reduce and anchor the Pd sites, forming isolated Pd1-N/C sites. Then, switching the argon to air, the carbonaceous skeletons are gasified and the ZrO2 nanoclusters are welded into a rigid and porous nanonet. Moreover, the reductive carbon will result in abundant oxygen (O*) defects, which could help to capture the migratory Pd1 species, leaving a sintering-resistant Pd1@ZrO2 catalyst via atom trapping. This Pd1@ZrO2 nanonet can act as a semi-homogeneous catalyst to boost the direct synthesis of indole through hydrogenation and intramolecular condensation processes, with an excellent turnover frequency (1109.2 h-1) and 94% selectivity.',\n",

As hydrogen gas was recently reported to activate PGC‑1α, the present study investigated whether it restores exhausted CD8+ T\\xa0cells to improve prognosis in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. A total of 55 patients with histologically and clinically diagnosed stage\\xa0IV colorectal carcinoma were enrolled between July 2014 and July 2017. The patients inhaled hydrogen gas for 3\\xa0h/day at their own homes and received chemotherapy at the Tamana Regional Health Medical Center (Tamana, Kumamoto, Japan). The CD8+ T\\xa0cells were isolated from the peripheral blood and their phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry. It was found that exhausted terminal programmed cell death\\xa01 (PD‑1)+ CD8+ T\\xa0cells in the peripheral blood are independently associated with worse progression‑free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Notably, hydrogen gas decreased the abundance of exhausted terminal PD‑1+ CD8+ T\\xa0cells, increased that of active terminal PD‑1‑ CD8+ T\\xa0cells, and improved PFS and OS times, suggesting that the balance between terminal PD1+ and PD1‑ CD8+ T\\xa0cells is critical for cancer prognosis. Therefore, a novel system for patient classification (category\\xa01‑4) was developed in the present study based on these two indices to assist in predicting the prognosis and therapeutic response. Collectively, the present results suggested that hydrogen gas reverses imbalances toward PD‑1+ CD8+ T\\xa0cells to provide an improved prognosis.',\n",
       " 'Background: Comprehensive evidence comparing treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) among PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is unavailable. Methods: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted. Randomized controlled trials in cancer patients treated with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors or their combinations with chemotherapy/placebo and compared with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors/chemotherapy/placebo were identified through comprehensive searches of multiple databases. Bayesian NMA was performed using random-effects model. Relative ranking of treatments was assessed with surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Incidences and odds ratios of trAEs and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of all-grade (Grade 1-5) and high-grade (Grade 3-5) were estimated. Results: Twenty-three RCTs (14,204 patients) comparing six different strategies were included. The incidence of trAEs was lowest for PD-L1 inhibitors (all-grade: pooled incidence = 60.4%, SUCRA = 77.2%; high-grade: 6.4, 73.8%). PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy had the highest incidence of all-grade trAEs (88.6, 10.1%), while PD-1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy had the highest incidence of high-grade trAEs (8.2, 9.3%). The use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone was associated with significant reductions on high-grade trAEs, compared with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy. PD-1 inhibitors had the highest incidence of irAEs (all-grade: 15.1, 9.5%; high-grade: 3.5, 16.8%). Compared with PD-L1 inhibitors, PD-1 inhibitors neither increased trAEs nor irAEs significantly. Results from sensitivity analyses were consistent. Conclusions: Current data showed that PD-L1 inhibitors had the best safety on both trAEs and irAEs. Awareness of the comparative safety could promote further appropriate utilization of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in clinical practice.',\n",

The purpose was to better characterize these three entities using immunohistochemistry and FISH (Fluorescent in situ hybridization) to identify biomarkers differently expressed and that might be involved in their pathogenesis. Twenty-two S-ALCL ALK-, 13 PC-ALCL, and 2 BI-ALCL were included. Cases were tested for P53, P63, MUM1, MYC, GATA3, p-STAT3, PD1, and PDL1 protein expression and DUP22, TP53, TP63, MYC, and PDL1 chromosomal aberrations. As expected, S-ALCL ALK- patients had adverse outcome compare to PC and BI-ALCL. No difference was observed between the three groups concerning protein expression except for MUM1 that was significantly more frequently expressed in S-ALCL ALK- compared to PC-ALCL. In particular, constitutive activation of the STAT3 pathway and PDL1/PD1 immune-checkpoint expression was present in the three entities. TP53 deletion and PDL1 gene amplification were the commonest cytogenetic alterations and were present in the three entities. None of the studied biological parameters was associated with prognosis. Despite distinct clinical behavior, S-ALCL ALK-, PC-ALCL, and BI-ALCL share similar biological features. Larger series should be investigated with the current approach to determine more precisely the activity and the prognostic value of these biomarkers and pathways in each group.',\n",

For patients who are not candidates for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, ACT using tumor antigen-experienced polyclonal T cells may be a treatment option. Since leukemic blasts reside in the bone marrow and bone marrow is a preferred site for homeostatic proliferation of cytotoxic memory CD8 T cells, we hypothesized that bone marrow would be a source of activated T cells. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using bone marrow-derived T cells following postinduction chemotherapy for use in adoptive cell transfer. Matched patient samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood-derived T cells expanded ex vivo and displayed similar apoptotic profiles. Before activation and expansion, there was a significant increase in the percentage of bone marrow-derived CD8 T cells expressing activation markers PD1, CD45RO, and CD69 as compared with peripheral blood CD8 T cells. Considering, melanoma-reactive CD8 T cells reside in the subset of PD1CD8 T cells, the bone marrow may be an enriched source leukemic-specific T cells that can be used for ACT.',\n",
       " 'Lung cancer incidence has increased worldwide over the past decades, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for the vast majority (85%) of lung cancer specimens. It is estimated that lung cancer causes about 1.7 million global deaths per year worldwide. Multiple trials have been carried out, with the aim of finding new effective treatment options. Lately, special focus has been placed on immune checkpoint (PD1/PD-L1) inhibitors which impact the tumor immune microenvironment. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been found to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Conversely, recent studies have weakened the significance of TMB as a predictor of response to therapy and survival. In this review article, we discuss the significance of TMB, as well as possible limitations. Furthermore, we give a concise overview of mutations frequently found in NSCLC, and discuss the significance of oncogene addiction in lung cancer as an essential driver of tumorigenesis and tumor progression.',\n",

We recently identified a subgroup of TNBC with loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN and five specific microRNAs that exhibits exceedingly poor clinical outcome and contains TP53 mutation, RB1 loss and high MYC and WNT signalling. Here, show that these PTEN-low/miRNA-low lesions cluster with BL1 TNBC. These tumors exhibited high RhoA signalling and were significantly stratified on the basis of PTEN-low/RhoA-signalling-high with hazard ratios (HRs) of 8.2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0009) and 4.87 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.033) in training and test cohorts, respectively.

Additional alterations, albeit without prognostic power, characterized each subtype including high E2F2 and TGFβ signalling and CXCL8 expression in BL2, high IFNα and IFNγ signalling and CTLA4 expression in IM, and high EGFR signalling in MSL, and may be targeted for therapy. This study identified PTEN-low/RhoA-signalling-high, and high AKT1 and PD1 expression as potent prognostications for BL1, BL2 and IM subtypes with survival differences of over 14, 2.75 and 10.5 years, respectively. This intrinsic heterogeneity could be exploited to prioritize patients for precision medicine.',\n",
       " 'The selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene in an ethylene-rich gas stream is an important process in the chemical industry. Pd-based catalysts are widely used in this reaction due to their excellent hydrogenation activity, though their selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation and durability need improvement. Herein, the successful synthesis of atomically dispersed Pd single-atom catalysts on nitrogen-doped graphene (Pd1 /N-graphene) by a freeze-drying-assisted method is reported. The Pd1 /N-graphene catalyst exhibits outstanding activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of C2 H2 with H2 in the presence of excess C2 H4 under photothermal heating (UV and visible-light irradiation from a Xe lamp), achieving 99% conversion of acetylene and 93.5% selectivity to ethylene at 125 °C. This remarkable catalytic performance is attributed to the high concentration of Pd active sites on the catalyst surface and the weak adsorption energy of ethylene on isolated Pd atoms, which prevents C2 H4 hydrogenation. Importantly, the Pd1 /N-graphene catalyst exhibits excellent durability at the optimal reaction temperature of 125 °C, which is explained by the strong local coordination of Pd atoms by nitrogen atoms, which suppresses the Pd aggregation. The results presented here encourage the wider pursuit of solar-driven photothermal catalyst systems based on single-atom active sites for selective hydrogenation reactions.',\n",

In this study, we analyzed a clinically annotated cohort of patients with melanoma (n\\u2009=\\u2009144) treated with anti-PD1 ICB, with whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing of pre-treatment tumors. We found that tumor mutational burden as a predictor of response was confounded by melanoma subtype, whereas multiple novel genomic and transcriptomic features predicted selective response, including features associated with MHC-I and MHC-II antigen presentation. Furthermore, previous anti-CTLA4 ICB exposure was associated with different predictors of response compared to tumors that were naive to ICB, suggesting selective immune effects of previous exposure to anti-CTLA4 ICB. Finally, we developed parsimonious models integrating clinical, genomic and transcriptomic features to predict intrinsic resistance to anti-PD1 ICB in individual tumors, with validation in smaller independent cohorts limited by the availability of comprehensive data. Broadly, we present a framework to discover predictive features and build models of ICB therapeutic response.',\n",

       " 'Coxsackievirus group B (CVB) is considered as one of the most common pathogens of human viral myocarditis. CVB-induced myocarditis is mainly characterized by the persistence of the virus infection and immune-mediated inflammatory injury. Costimulatory signals are crucial for the activation of adaptive immunity. Our data reveal that the CVB type 3 (CVB3) infection altered the expression profile of costimulatory molecules in host cells. CVB3 infection caused the decrease of PD-1 ligand expression, partially due to the cleavage of AU-rich element binding protein AUF1 by the viral protease 3Cpro, leading to the exacerbated inflammatory injury of the myocardium. Moreover, systemic PD-L1 treatment, which augmented the apoptosis of proliferating lymphocytes, alleviated myocardial inflammatory injury. Our findings suggest that PD1-pathway can be a potential immunologic therapeutic target for CVB-induced myocarditis.',\n",

Nearly 10 years after the approval of cetuximab, anti-PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are the first drugs that have shown any survival benefit for the treatment on platinum-refractory recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC. Furthermore, checkpoint inhibitors are better tolerated than chemotherapy. The state of the art in the treatment of R/M HNSCC is changing, thanks to improved results for checkpoint inhibitors. Results for these treatments are also awaited in curative settings and for locally advanced HNSCC. Unfortunately, the response rate of immunotherapy is low. Therefore, the identification of predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to anti-PD1/PD-L1 is a key point for better selecting patients that would benefit the most from immunotherapy. Furthermore, the combination of checkpoint inhibitors with various agents is being currently evaluated to improve the response rate, prolong response duration, and even increase the chances for a cure. In this review, we summarize the most important results regarding immune targeting agents for HNSCC, predictive biomarkers for resistance to immune therapies, and future perspectives.',\n",

Here we report the prognostic significance of these immune biomarkers in an independent validation cohort of 177 HPV+OPSCC patients. IT and stromal (S) localisation of PD-L1+ and CD8+ ICs were scored. High abundance (≥5%) of PD-L1+ IT ICs was found in 51/167 patients (30.5%) and was associated with improved overall survival (OS) (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.91; P\\xa0=\\xa00. 012) validating our previous results. High abundance (≥30%) of CD8+ IT or S ICs, found in 77/167 patients (46.1%) provided a HR of 0.45 for OS however the confidence interval was wide (95% CI 0.16-1.25, p\\xa0=\\xa00.105). Multiplex immunohistochemistry revealed CD68+ macrophages and CD3+CD8+ T cells to be the most common ICs expressing PD-L1. Gene expression analysis showed tumors with high abundance of PD-L1+ IT ICs exhibit gene signatures associated with responses to PD1 or PD-L1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. These data support the role of immune biomarkers such as PD-L1+ ICs to identify subgroups of HPV+OPSCC patients with an excellent outcome that may be suitable for trials evaluating de-intensification of therapy.',\n",
       " 'Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is the standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The clinical significance of peripheral blood T lymphocyte (PBTL) immunologic changes associated with ASCT is poorly understood. Here we evaluated T cell transcriptional messenger RNA profiles and immunophenotypes to correlate immunologic senescence, exhaustion, and anergy with clinical endpoints in a cohort of patients with MM undergoing ASCT. ASCT induced global transcriptional T cell changes and altered molecular levels of markers of T cell subtypes, T cell activation, and exhaustion. These included reduced CD4/CD8 ratio, skewing toward the Th1 subset, reduced expression of costimulatory receptors CD27 and CD28, heightened T cell activation, and increased expression of immune modulatory molecules LAG3 and PD1. Multicolor flow cytometry experiments confirmed altered circulating CD4 and CD8 subsets and skewing toward differentiated effector cells. Moreover, ASCT promoted an exhausted immunophenotype in CD3+CD4+ subsets and a senescent immunophenotype in CD3+CD8+ subsets. Subset-specific altered expression was also seen for surface molecules with immunomodulatory function. ASCT affected soluble levels of molecules with immunomodulatory function by increasing plasma HVEM and TIM3. High molecular LAG3 level was associated with inferior event-free survival post-ASCT (hazard ratio = 5.44; confidence interval, 1.92 to 15.46; P\\u202f= .001; adjusted P [controlling for false discovery rate]\\u202f=\\u202f.038). Using a comprehensive evaluation of PBTLs on a molecular and phenotypic level, we have identified that ASCT induces global T cell alterations with CD4 and CD8 subset-specific changes. Moreover, LAG3 emerged as an early biomarker of adverse events post-ASCT. These findings will support the development of treatment strategies targeting immune defects in MM to augment or restore T cell responses.',\n",
       " 'The interaction event between programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) functions as an essential immune checkpoint against cytotoxic T effector cell activation. Previously, a number of small-molecule inhibitors and antibody drugs have been successfully developed to block the PD1/PDL1 signaling axis for breast cancer immunotherapy. Here, we attempt to directly disrupt the formation of PD-1/PD-L1 complex by using a self-inhibitory peptide (SIP) strategy. In the procedure, the complex crystal structure is examined systematically with energetic analysis and alanine scanning. Two double-stranded segments I and II in PD-L1 active finger are identified as hotspot regions; they directly interact with the amphipathic pocket of PD-1 to form the complex system. The segments are derived from PD-L1 to define two SIP peptides, namely, DS-I and DS-II, which are thought to have capability of rebinding at the complex interface, thus disrupting PD-1/PD-L1 interaction as a new immune checkpoint blockade. A further analysis reveals that the free linear DS-I and DS-II peptides are highly flexible without protein context support, which would incur a large entropy penalty (unfavorable indirect readout effect) when rebinding to PD-1. Next, intramolecular cyclization is applied to constraining the intrinsically disordered conformation of free DS-II peptide into native ordered double-stranded configuration, which can be substantiated by molecular dynamics simulation and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Several cyclized counterparts of linear DS-II peptide are designed and their affinities to PD-1 are determined using fluorescence polarization assays. As might be expected, three designed cyclic peptides DS-II[c111-127], ΔDS-II[c111-127] and ΔDS-II[c110-128] exhibit considerably increased potency (Kd\\u202f=\\u202f28.0\\u202f±\\u202f4.2, 17.5\\u202f±\\u202f3.1 and 11.6\\u202f±\\u202f2.3\\u202fμM, respectively) relative to linear DS-II peptide (Kd\\u202f=\\u202f109\\u202f±\\u202f15\\u202fμM).',\n",

       " 'Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a naturally occurring, habitually consumed food constituent throughout the world. Prospective cohort studies revealed that caffeine consumption reduces the relative risk of various cancers. Avoiding immune destruction is one of the emerging hallmarks of cancer. One of the immunosuppressive pathways that contribute in avoiding immune destruction by cancer cells is adenosine-A2A receptor pathway. Based on prospective epidemiological and mechanistic preclinical studies of caffeine and its predominant antagonistic effect on A2A receptor, we aimed to investigate the effect of caffeine on T cell infiltration into the tumor and expression of PD-1 receptor on T lymphocytes during tumor initiation and progression in a carcinogen-induced tumor model. Our results demonstrate that caffeine treatment significantly lowered tumor incidence and tumor growth rate. We found that the total T-lymphocyte infiltration and CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration was significantly increased in caffeine-treated groups. On the other hand, the infiltration of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T lymphocyte was significantly decreased in caffeine-treated groups. In addition, the PD-1 expression on CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T lymphocytes was significantly reduced in caffeine-treated groups. We further investigated whether the observed anti-tumor effect of caffeine is mediated through the release of cytokines. We found that TNF-α and IFN-γ levels were significantly higher in caffeine-treated groups. The findings of the present study unraveled the immune-related mechanisms behind the caffeinated coffee consumption and lower tumor incidence in humans. In conclusion, the blockade of adenosine pathway by caffeine may constitute an effective means to enhance anti-tumor immune response.',\n",

Results: CD68+PD1+ macrophages which can express higher M2 markers in cancer tissues, increased about 4.2-times compared with para-cancer tissues. Additionally, PD1high macrophages were significantly correlated with more malignant phenotypes and poor prognosis.

       " 'In photosystem II (PSII), water oxidation occurs in the Mn4CaO5 cluster with the release of electrons via the redox-active tyrosine (TyrZ) to the reaction-center chlorophylls (PD1/PD2). Using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach, we report the redox potentials (Em) of these cofactors in the PSII protein environment. The Em values suggest that the Mn4CaO5 cluster, TyrZ, and PD1/PD2 form a downhill electron transfer pathway. Em for the first oxidation step, Em(S0/S1), is uniquely low (730 mV) and is ∼100 mV lower than that for the second oxidation step, Em(S1/S2) (830 mV) only when the O4 site of the Mn4CaO5 cluster is protonated in S0. The O4-water chain, which directly forms a low-barrier H-bond with the Mn4CaO5 cluster and mediates proton-coupled electron transfer in the S0 to S1 transition, explains why the second lowest oxidation state, S1, is the most stable and S0 is converted to S1 even in the dark.',\n",
       " 'Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is an attractive candidate for oncolytic immunotherapy due to its ability to replicate in tumor cells and potentially overcome the inherently immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment. The advent of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy over the past few years represents a paradigm shift in cancer therapy. However, the prevalence of severe immune-related adverse events with CTLA-4 and PD1 pathway blockade in clinical studies especially in combination therapy groups, is a cause for concern. Immunotherapies with cytokines have also been extensively explored but they have been associated with adverse events in clinical trials. Oncolytic vectors engineered to express checkpoint blockade antibodies and cytokines could provide an avenue for reducing the clinical toxicity associated with systemic therapy by concentrating the immunomodulatory payload at the site of disease. In this study, we engineered six different recombinant viruses, NDVs expressing checkpoint inhibitors (rNDV-anti-PD1 and rNDV-anti-PDL1), superagonists (rNDV-anti-CD28) and immunocytokines, where these antibodies are fused to an immunostimulatory cytokine such as IL12 (rNDV-anti-CD28-mIL12, rNDV-anti-PD1-mIL12 and rNDV-anti-PDL1-mIL12). These six engineered viruses induced tumor control and survival benefit both in a highly aggressive unilateral and bilateral B16-F10 murine melanoma model, indicative of an abscopal effect. The data represent a strong proof-of-concept, on which further clinical evaluation could build.IMPORTANCE Checkpoint inhibitor therapy has shown tremendous efficacy but also frequent and often severe side effects-especially when multiple drugs of this class are used simultaneously. Similarly, many investigational immunotherapy agents, which have shown promise in animal models, have failed in clinical trials due to dose-limiting toxicity when administered systemically. This study utilized a murine melanoma model to evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral injections of recombinant NDVs engineered to express multiple immunotherapeutic proteins with well-documented side effects in humans. Our results indicate that intratumoral administration of these recombinant NDVs, particularly when combined with systemic CTLA4 checkpoint inhibition, exerts a robust effect in treated and non-treated tumors indicative of a systemic anti-tumoral response. The intratumoral delivery of rNDVs expressing immunotherapeutic proteins may be an effective method of targeting immune cell populations most relevant for anti-tumoral immunity and allowing to restrict the use of systemic immunotherapy agents.',\n",

PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor for regulating the immune system and preventing development of autoimmune disorders. This study aimed to determine the role of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1 or PD-1) gene and haplotypes defined by these SNPs in susceptibility to SLE in the Iranian population. Blood samples were obtained from 253 SLE and 564 healthy subjects. Red blood cells were lysed and genomic DNAs were extracted using salting-out method. Genotype determinations of PD1.1, PD1.3, PD1.5 and PD1.9 SNPs were performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and 12 haplotypes were constructed by PDCD1 SNPs. Our results showed significant differences in PD1.5 genotype frequencies between patient and control groups (p\\xa0<\\xa0.001). The frequencies of PD1.5 C/C, C/T and T/T genotypes versus other genotypes in SLE patients significantly differed from healthy subjects (p\\xa0<\\xa0.001, p\\xa0=\\xa0.001 and p\\xa0=\\xa0.002, respectively). Allelic analysis indicated a significant association between the frequency of PD1.5C allele and development of SLE in our population (odds ratio [OR]\\xa0=\\xa01.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.51-2.42, p\\xa0<\\xa0.001).

       " 'In general, reduction of N2O by CO is first performed by N2O decomposition over a catalyst surface to release N2 and form an active oxygen species, and subsequently CO is oxidized by the active oxygen species to produce CO2. However, the strong adsorption behavior of CO on the catalyst surface usually inhibits adsorption and decomposition of N2O, which leads to a low activity or poisoning of catalysts. In the present paper, a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) [correction] mechanism has been probed based on a series of phosphotungstic acid (PTA) supported single-atom catalysts (SACs), M1/PTA (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Pt, and Pd). Although the calculated adsorption energy of CO is exceedingly higher than N2O for our studied systems, the adsorbed CO could react with the surface oxygen atom of the PTA support through the MvK mechanism to form an oxygen vacancy on the PTA surface. N2O acts as an oxygen donor to replenish the PTA support and release N2 in the whole reaction process. This proposed reaction mechanism avoids competitive adsorption and poisoning of the catalyst caused by CO. The calculated adsorption energy, oxygen vacancy formation energy, and the free energy profiles show that the catalytic activity of Pd1/PTA, Rh1/PTA, and Pt1/PTA SACs is quite high, especially for Pt1/PTA and Pd1/PTA systems. Meanwhile, molecular geometry and electronic structure analysis along the favorable reaction pathway indicates that the metal single atom not only plays the role of adsorbing CO and activating surface atoms of the PTA support but also works as an electron transfer media in the whole reaction process. We expect that the present calculated results could provide some clues for the search for appropriate catalyst for reduction of N2O to N2 by CO at low temperature.',\n",
       " 'It is estimated that pancreatic cancer will be the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally by 2030, highlighting the ongoing lack of effective treatment options for this devastating condition. There is a lack of reliable prognostic or predictive markers in pancreatic cancer to guide management decisions, whether for systemic chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapies, or immunotherapies. To date, the results for targeted agents and immunotherapies in unselected populations of chemo-refractory pancreatic cancer have not met expectations. The reasons for this lack of efficacy of immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer are not completely understood. The challenges in pancreatic cancer include the physical barrier created by the dense desmoplastic stroma surrounding the tumor, chemokine-mediated exclusion of T cells, relatively poorer antigenicity compared to other solid tumors, paucity of infiltrating T cells within the tumor, ultimately leading to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. A better understanding of the role of inflammation in pancreatic cancer, its tumor microenvironment and individualized patient-related features, be they molecular, clinical or histopathological, would enable a more effective tailored approach to the management of pancreatic cancer. In this review, the role of inflammation, the immune tumor microenvironment and potential immune biomarkers in pancreatic cancer are explored.',\n",
       " 'Esophageal cancer (EC) is among the most frequent and deadly cancers around the world. While esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has one of the fastest-growing incidences amongst cancers in the US, it also has one of the lowest survival rates due to the limited effective treatment options. Fortunately, in the past decade, two targeted therapies and an immunotherapy agent have been approved by the FDA for metastatic EAC and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), with several more currently being considered for approval. In terms of immunotherapies, in July 2019, the FDA approved the PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab for second-line treatment of PDL1-positive, advanced or metastatic ESCC. Two years before, pembrolizumab had been approved for the third-line treatment of PDL1-positive EAC. The PD1 inhibitor nivolumab, which was found in one study to outperform chemotherapy irrespective of PDL1 status, has yet to secure FDA approval. In terms of targeted therapies, although as many as 90% of EC cases show upregulated EGFR, anti-EGFR therapy has not been shown to improve survival. Ramucirumab, an antibody targeting both VEGF and HER2/neu receptors, has been approved for the treatment of refractory EAC, while the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab has been approved as front-line treatment for HER2-positive cases which account for approximately 20% of ECs. Although these targeted therapies and immunotherapies have resulted in significant improvements in survival for specific patient populations that are positive for certain biomarkers, such as PDL1 and HER2/neu, the survival rates remain low for a large proportion of the metastatic EC patient population, necessitating the development of further targeted treatment options.',\n",
       " 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The appropriate duration for ICI treatment is not clear, however. Analyses of landmark trials reveal that some patients exhibit sustained durable responses to ICIs even after treatment discontinuation, resulting in prolonged treatment-free intervals that can mitigate potential toxicities and the considerable financial burden associated with treatment. Adaptive approaches with PD1 monotherapy and combination immunotherapy tailored to tumor response are ongoing. More efforts will be needed to clarify the ideal ICI dosing regimen to maximize oncological benefit while minimizing treatment-related adverse effects and costs. PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed considerations surrounding treatment strategies when using immunotherapy to treat patients with kidney cancer. It is clear that some patients can experience prolonged cancer control when discontinuing immunotherapy.

Due to the lack of reports on PD-1- and PD-L1-positive lymphocyte proportions in patients with recurrent furunculosis, we aimed to evaluate percentages of those cells in the peripheral blood and to assess their correlations with other lymphocyte subsets, and the level of cell activation measured by the expression of CD25 and CD69 molecules on T lymphocytes. We recruited 30 patients with recurrent furunculosis and 15 controls. The amount of 5\\u202fmL of peripheral blood was collected for laboratory tests. Patients with chronic furunculosis presented with the similar number of lymphocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+CD3+ T suppressor lymphocytes, and CD19\\u202f+\\xa0B lymphocytes to controls, but significant differences were found between subpopulation of those cells. Furunculosis patients had the significantly elevated percentage of lymphocytes with PD-1 and PD-L1 on their surface. Early onset of furunculosis was correlated with a higher percentage of CD19\\xa0+\\xa0PD1 B lymphocytes. Greater number of skin lesions correlated with a decrease in the CD4PDL1+ cells, which subsequently was associated with an increase in the percentage of Treg cells, NKT cells, CD8+CD3+ lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. Changes in the proportion of immune cells may lead to reduced inflammatory reactions in patients with recurrent furunculosis. In the light of mechanisms of S. aureus invasion, the degree of immune impairments in the scope of adaptive immunity seems to play a significant role in the course of furunculosis. PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules change the host response and affect the ongoing inflammatory process.',\n",
       " 'Advances in our understanding οf tumor immunity have prompted a paradigm shift in oncology, with the emergence of immunotherapy, where therapeutic agents are used to target immune cells rather than cancer cells. A real breakthrough in the field of immunotherapy came with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), namely antagonistic antibodies that block key immune regulatory molecules (checkpoint molecules), such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1, that under physiologic conditions suppress T cell effector function. However, despite the enormous success, a significant proportion of patients do not respond, while responses are frequently accompanied by life-threatening autoimmune related adverse events (irAEs). A major impediment in the effectiveness of ICI immunotherapy is the tumoral resistance, which is dependent on the immunosuppressive nature of tumor microenvironment (TME). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are among the most abundant suppressive cells in the TME and their presence has been correlated with tumor progression, invasiveness as well as metastasis. Tregs are characterized by the expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 and various mechanisms ranging from cell-to-cell contact to secretion of inhibitory molecules have been implicated in their function. Notably, Tregs amply express most of the checkpoint molecules such as CTLA4, PD1 and LAG3 and therefore represent a direct target of ICI immunotherapy. Taking into consideration the critical role of Tregs in maintenance of immune homeostasis and avoidance of autoimmunity it is plausible that targeting of Tregs by ICI immunotherapy results in the development of irAEs. Since the use of ICI becomes common, and new immune checkpoint molecules are currently under clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, the occurrence of irAEs is expected to dramatically rise. Herein we review the current literature focusing on the role of Tregs in cancer evolution, ICI response and development of irAEs. Unraveling the complex mechanisms that hinder the tumor immune surveillance and in particular how ICI immunotherapy imprint on Treg activities to promote cancer regression while avoid development of irAEs, will empower the design of novel immunotherapeutic modalities in cancer with increased efficacy and diminished adverse events.',\n",

However, clinical trials have failed to show consistent benefit of ICT over concurrent radio-chemotherapy and due to so far lacking level 1 evidence ICT outside larynx organ preservation remains rather investigational.

Previous reports have shown that increased T-cell numbers and CD28null phenotype is predictive of prognosis in IPF, suggesting that these cells might have a role in this disease. Flow cytometric analysis of explanted lung cellular suspensions showed a significant increase in CD8+ CD28null T cells in IPF relative to normal lung explants. Transcriptomic analysis of CD3+ T cells isolated from IPF lung explants revealed a loss of CD28-transcript expression and elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in IPF relative to normal T cells. IPF lung explant-derived T cells (enriched with CD28null T cells), but not normal donor lung CD28+ T cells induced dexamethasone-resistant lung remodeling in humanized NSG mice. Finally, CD28null T cells expressed similar CTLA4 and significantly higher levels of PD-1 proteins relative to CD28+ T cells and blockade of either proteins in humanized NSG mice, using anti-CTLA4, or anti-PD1, mAb treatment-accelerated lung fibrosis. Together, these results demonstrate that IPF CD28null T cells may promote lung fibrosis but the immune checkpoint proteins, CTLA-4 and PD-1, appears to limit this effect.',\n",

       " 'The control of steroidogenesis in the neonatal adrenal gland is of great clinical interest. We have previously demonstrated that the postnatal day (PD) 2 rat exhibits a large plasma corticosterone response to hypoxia in the absence of an increase in plasma ACTH measured by RIA, whereas the corticosterone response to exogenous ACTH is intact. By PD8, the corticosterone response to hypoxia is clearly ACTH-dependent. We hypothesized that this apparently ACTH-independent response to hypoxia in the newborn rat is due to an increase in a bioactive, nonimmunoassayable form of ACTH. To evaluate this phenomenon, we pretreated neonatal rats with a novel, specific, neutralizing anti-ACTH antibody (ALD1611) (20 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg IP) on the morning of PD1, PD7, and PD14. Twenty-four hours later, we measured hypoxia- or ACTH-stimulated plasma ACTH and corticosterone. For long-term effects, ALD1611 was given on PD1 and pups were studied on PD8 and PD15. Pretreatment with ALD1611 significantly decreased baseline corticosterone and completely blocked the corticosterone response to hypoxia and exogenous ACTH stimulation at all ages. The effect of 1 mg/kg ALD1611 on PD1 had dissipated by PD15. The decrease in corticosterone in ALD1611-treated pups was associated with decreases in baseline and hypoxia- and ACTH-stimulated adrenal Ldlr, Mrap, and Star mRNA expression at all ages. The adrenal response to hypoxia in the newborn rat is ACTH-dependent, suggesting the release of nonimmunoassayable, biologically active forms of ACTH. ALD1611 is useful as a tool to attenuate stress-induced, ACTH-dependent adrenal steroidogenesis in vivo.',\n",
       " 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are novel anticancer agents, recently introduced with the aim of boosting the immune response against tumors. ICIs are monoclonal autoantibodies that specifically target inhibitory receptors on T cells: cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-1L). ICIs also generate peculiar dysimmune toxicities, called immune-related adverse events (irAEs), that can potentially affect any tissue, and some may be life-threatening if not promptly recognized. The endocrine and metabolic side effects of ICIs are reviewed here, with a particular focus on their clinical presentation and management. They are among the most frequent toxicities (around 10%) and include hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, adrenalitis, and diabetes mellitus. Treatment is based on the replacement of specific hormone deficits, accompanied by immunosuppression (with corticosteroids or other drugs), depending on irAEs grade, often without the need of ICI withdrawal, except in more severe forms. Prompt recognition of endocrine and metabolic irAEs and adequate treatment allow the patients to continue a therapy they are benefiting from. Endocrinologists, as an integral part of the multidisciplinary oncologic team, need to be familiar with the unique toxicity profile of these anticancer agents.

We observe that the blockade of LIF in tumors expressing high levels of LIF decreases CD206, CD163 and CCL2 and induces CXCL9 expression in tumor-associated macrophages. The blockade of LIF releases the epigenetic silencing of CXCL9 triggering CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration. The combination of LIF neutralizing antibodies with the inhibition of the PD1 immune checkpoint promotes tumor regression, immunological memory and an increase in overall survival.',\n",
       " 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly immune-suppressive tumor with a low response rate to single checkpoint blockade therapy. ETS homologous factor (EHF) is a tumor suppressor in PDAC. Here, we report a novel function of EHF in pancreatic cancer immune microenvironment editing and efficacy prediction for anti-PD1 therapy. Our findings support that the deficiency of tumoral EHF induced the accumulation of regulatory T (T reg) cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and a decrease in the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, EHF deficiency induced the conversion and expansion of T reg cells and MDSCs through inhibiting tumor TGFβ1 and GM-CSF secretion. EHF suppressed the transcription of TGFB1 and CSF2 by directly binding to their promoters. Mice bearing EHF overexpression tumors exhibited significantly better response to anti-PD1 therapy than those with control tumors. Our findings delineate the immunosuppressive mechanism of EHF deficiency in PDAC and highlight that EHF overexpression may improve PDAC checkpoint immunotherapy.',\n",
       " 'PD1 blockade is effective in a subset of patients with B-cell lymphoma (e.g., classical-Hodgkin lymphomas); however, most patients do not respond to anti-PD1 therapy. To study PD1 resistance, we used an isoform-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi; OKI-179), and a mouse mature B-cell lymphoma, G1XP lymphoma, immunosuppressive features of which resemble those of human B-cell lymphomas, including downregulation of MHC class I and II, exhaustion of CD8+ and CD4+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and PD1-blockade resistance. Using two lymphoma models, we show that treatment of B-cell lymphomas refractory to PD1 blockade with both OKI-179 and anti-PD1 inhibited growth; furthermore, sensitivity to single or combined treatment required tumor-derived MHC class I, and positively correlated with MHC class II expression level. We conclude that OKI-179 sensitizes lymphomas to PD1-blockade by enhancing tumor immunogenicity. In addition, we found that different HDACis exhibited distinct effects on tumors and T cells, yet the same HDACi could differentially affect HLA expression on different human B-cell lymphomas. Our study highlights the immunologic effects of HDACis on antitumor responses and suggests that optimal treatment efficacy requires personalized design and rational combination based on prognostic biomarkers (e.g., MHCs) and the individual profiles of HDACi.',\n",

       " 'γδT cells hold a pivotal role in tumor immunosurveillance through their prompt activation and cytokine secretion, their ability to kill tumor cells in an Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-unrestricted manner, and their combination of features of both innate and adaptive immunity. These unique properties and functional plasticity render them very attractive both as targets and vectors for cancer immunotherapy. Yet, these potent and fascinating antitumor effectors have not been extensively explored in melanoma. We provided here a detailed investigation of the phenotypic and functional properties of circulating and tumor-infiltrating γδT cells in melanoma patients, and their impact on clinical evolution. High proportions of circulating- and tumor-infiltrating γδT and δ2+\\xa0subset were associated with better clinical outcome. We reported however that circulating and tumor-infiltrating γδT cells from melanoma patients displayed an altered expression of NCR, KIR, and immune checkpoints, and identified NKp44, PD1, 41BB/41BBL, TIM3, and LAG3 as crucial checkpoints allowing immune escape and tumor progression. Notably, melanoma drastically impaired the ability of γδT cells to exhibit activation molecules, secrete cytokines, and display cytotoxicity toward melanoma in response to stimulation with phosphoantigens. It drove them toward regulatory and Th17 profiles associated with poor clinical outcomes. Our study highlights that melanoma hijacked γδT cells to escape from immune control, and revealed that circulating and tumor-infiltrating γδT cell features are promising potential biomarkers of clinical evolution. Such understanding of the physiopathology of γδT cells may help designing new therapeutic approaches exploiting the antitumor potential of γδT cells while counteracting their skewing by tumors to improve patient outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a peripheral T-cell lymphoma derived from follicular T-helper cells. High-throughput genomic sequencing studies have shown that angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma carries frequent mutations in RHOAG17V and IDH2R172 genes. The clinico-pathological features of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma cases with RHOAG17V mutations have been addressed; however, similar studies for IDH2 mutated cases are lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the pathological features of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with IDH2 mutations. In order to identify cases with IDH2 mutations, 50 cases previously diagnosed as angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma were subjected to next-generation sequencing analysis using a custom panel covering four genes frequently mutated in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma including DNMT3A, TET2, IDH2 and RHOA. All cases were analyzed for PD1, ICOS, CXCL13, CD10, BCL6, CD21, CD23 and EBER in situ hybridization. Mutational analysis recognized three groups. Group 1: IDH2R172 mutations were identified in 20 cases (40%). All cases carried RHOAG17V mutations. Group 2: RHOAG17V mutations without IDH2R172 mutation were identified in 16 cases (32%), and Group 3: 14 cases (28%) without RHOAG17V or IDH2R172 mutations. Morphologically, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma cases with IDH2R172 mutations were characterized by the presence of medium to large clear cells (p\\u2009=\\u20090.00001), and a follicular T-helper phenotype with the particular feature of strong CD10 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.0268) and CXCL13 expression (p\\u2009=\\u20090.0346). Interestingly, TET2 mutations were identified in 32 of 33 (97%) cases with IDH2R172 and/or RHOAG17V mutations whereas only 55% of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma cases wild-type for these two genes carried TET2 mutations (p\\u2009=\\u20090.0022). In contrast, DNMT3A mutations were found in 48% of the cases and were equally distributed in the three groups. In conclusion, our results support the results of gene expression profiling studies suggesting that IDH2R172 mutations define a unique subgroup within angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with strong follicular T-helper-like phenotype and characteristic morphological features.',\n",

       " 'The tumor microenvironment is an important determinant of glioblastoma (GBM) progression and response to treatment. How oncogenic signaling in GBM cells modulates the composition of the tumor microenvironment and its activation is unclear. We aimed to explore the potential local immunoregulatory function of ERK1/2 signaling in GBM. Using proteomic and transcriptomic data (RNA seq) available for GBM tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show that GBM with high levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 have increased infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with a non-inflammatory M2 polarization. Using three human GBM cell lines in culture, we confirmed the existence of ERK1/2-dependent regulation of the production of the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2/MCP1. In contrast with this positive regulation of TAM recruitment, we found no evidence of a direct effect of ERK1/2 signaling on two other important aspects of TAM regulation by GBM cells: (1) the expression of the immune checkpoint ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, expressed at high mRNA levels in GBM compared with other solid tumors; (2) the production of the tumor metabolite lactate recently reported to dampen tumor immunity by interacting with the receptor GPR65 present on the surface of TAM. Taken together, our observations suggest that ERK1/2 signaling regulates the recruitment of TAM in the GBM microenvironment. These findings highlight some potentially important particularities of the immune microenvironment in GBM and could provide an explanation for the recent observation that GBM with activated ERK1/2 signaling may respond better to anti-PD1 therapeutics.',\n",
       " 'Oncolytic viruses preferentially replicate in tumors as compared to normal tissue and promote immunogenic cell death and induction of host systemic anti-tumor immunity. HSV-1 was chosen for further development as an oncolytic immunotherapy in this study as it is highly lytic, infects human tumor cells broadly, kills mainly by necrosis and is a potent activator of both innate and adaptive immunity. HSV-1 also has a large capacity for the insertion of additional, potentially therapeutic, exogenous genes. Finally, HSV-1 has a proven safety and efficacy profile in patients with cancer, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), an oncolytic HSV-1 which expresses GM-CSF, being the only oncolytic immunotherapy approach that has received FDA approval. As the clinical efficacy of oncolytic immunotherapy has been shown to be further enhanced by combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, developing improved oncolytic platforms which can synergize with other existing immunotherapies is a high priority. In this study we sought to further optimize HSV-1 based oncolytic immunotherapy through multiple approaches to maximize: (i) the extent of tumor cell killing, augmenting the release of tumor antigens and danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) factors; (ii) the immunogenicity of tumor cell death; and (iii) the resulting systemic anti-tumor immune response.',\n",

However, difficulties in production, stability, the requirement of frequent high doses for antibody administration and long intravenous administration are recurring issues. Synthetically designed DNA-encoded monoclonal antibodies (DMAbs) are a novel delivery method for antibody therapy which could potentially address many of these issues, simplifying design and implementation of MAb-based therapies. DMAbs delivered through plasmid DNA injection and electroporation have been used in preclinical models for the treatment or prophylaxis of infectious diseases, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Our group has recently reported that immune checkpoint blockers can be optimized and delivered in vivo advancing further DMAb technology by optimization, expression and in vivo functional characterization of anti-CTLA4 antibodies. Here we report optimization, expression and binding of DMAbs based on anti-PD1 CPI and discuss the potential of DMAbs in checkpoint immunotherapy.',\n",

Genetic vaccines based on Adenoviruses derived from non-human Great Apes (GAd) elicit strong and effective T cell-mediated immunity in humans. Here, we investigate for the first time the potency and efficacy of a novel GAd encoding multiple neoantigens. Prophylactic or early therapeutic vaccination with GAd efficiently control tumor growth in mice. In contrast, combination of the vaccine with checkpoint inhibitors is required to eradicate large tumors. Gene expression profile of tumors in regression shows abundance of activated tumor infiltrating T cells with a more diversified TCR repertoire in animals treated with GAd and anti-PD1 compared to anti-PD1. Data suggest that effectiveness of vaccination in the presence of high tumor burden correlates with the breadth of nAgs-specific T cells and requires concomitant reversal of tumor suppression by checkpoint blockade.',\n",
       " \"Immunotherapy and opioids treatment are new causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI). Prevalence of SAI with immunotherapy is more frequent with combined therapy (8% vs 4 to 10% with CTLA4 blocking antibody and 1% with PD1 blocking antibody). Although hypophysitis are more frequently observed with CTLA4 blocking antibody, some cases of Isolated SAI have been reported in patients treated by PD1 blocking antibody. SAI could be transient, requiring long-term monitoring. The use of opioid analgesics is increasing in many countries, thus becoming a public health problem. Prevalence of opioid-related SAI is unclear but recent prospective studies reveal a prevalence between 5 and 20%. The main risk factor to develop this pathology is morphine-equivalent daily dose. Diagnosis relies on 8.00 am plasma cortisol measurement and cortisol increase after Synacthen® administration. Recent cortisol immuno-assays, in agreement with mass spectrometry, give lower reference values, encouraging reevaluation of the current cut-off of 500 nmol/L. New modified-release hydrocortisone preparations have been recently developed to better mimic the physiological cortisol rhythm and to improve compliance in adrenocortical deficient patients. Nowadays, continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion seems to be a unique replacement therapy allowing adequate circadian biorhythm but should be restricted to specific patients due to the complexity of this substituting strategy. © 2019 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

       " \"Indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (iNHLs) are incurable with standard therapy and are poorly responsive to checkpoint blockade. Although lymphoma cells are efficiently killed by primed T cells, in vivo priming of anti-lymphoma T cells has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that lymphoma cells can directly prime T cells, but in vivo immunity still requires cross-presentation. To address this, we developed an in situ vaccine (ISV), combining Flt3L, radiotherapy, and a TLR3 agonist, which recruited, antigen-loaded and activated intratumoral, cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs). ISV induced anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses and systemic (abscopal) cancer remission in patients with advanced stage iNHL in an ongoing trial ( NCT01976585 ). Non-responding patients developed a population of PD1+CD8+ T cells after ISV, and murine tumors became newly responsive to PD1 blockade, prompting a follow-up trial of the combined therapy. Our data substantiate that recruiting and activating intratumoral, cross-priming DCs is achievable and critical to anti-tumor T cell responses and PD1-blockade efficacy.\",\n",

Despite improved knowledge regarding the genetic background of the tumor and better understanding of the tumor microenvironment, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (targeting CTLA4, PD1, PDL1) has not been very successful against PDAC. The robust desmoplastic stroma, along with an extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in hyaluronan, plays an integral role in this immune evasion. Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), a shunt pathway of glycolysis, is a metabolic node in cancer cells that can promote survival pathways on the one hand and influence the hyaluronan synthesis in the ECM on the other. The rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, glutamine-fructose amidotransferase 1 (GFAT1), uses glutamine and fructose 6-phosphate to eventually synthesize uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). In the current manuscript, we targeted this glutamine-utilizing enzyme by a small molecule glutamine analog (6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine [DON]). Our results showed that DON decreased the self-renewal potential and metastatic ability of tumor cells. Further, treatment with DON decreased hyaluronan and collagen in the tumor microenvironment, leading to an extensive remodeling of the ECM and an increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Additionally, treatment with DON sensitized pancreatic tumors to anti-PD1 therapy, resulting in tumor regression and prolonged survival.',\n",

Multiple PD-L1 IHC assays with various antibodies and cut points have been used in clinical trials across tumor types. Comparative performance characteristics of these assays have been extensively studied qualitatively but not quantitatively. Here we evaluate the use of a standardized PD-L1 Index tissue microarray (TMA) to objectively determine agreement between antibody assays for PD-L1 applying quantitative digital image analysis. Using a specially constructed Index TMA containing a panel of ten isogenic cell lines in triplicate, we tested identical but independently grown batches of isogenic cells to prove Index TMAs can be produced in large quantities and hence serve as a standardization tool. Then the Index TMAs were evaluated using quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) to validate the TMA itself and also to compare antibodies including E1L3N, SP142 and SP263. Next, an inter-laboratory and inter-assay comparison of 5 PD-L1 chromogenic IHC assays (US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and lab developed test (LDT)) were performed at 12 sites around the USA. As previously reported, the SP142 FDA assay failed to detect low levels of PD-L1 in cell lines distinguished by the other four assays. The assays for 22C3 FDA, 28-8-FDA, SP263 FDA, and E1L3N LDT were highly similar across sites and all laboratories showed a high consistency over time for all assays using this Index TMA. In conclusion, we were able to objectively quantify PD-L1 expression on a standardized Index TMA using digital image analysis and we confirmed previous subjective assessments of these assays, but now in a multi-institutional setting. We envision commercial use of this Index TMA or similar smaller version as a useful standardization mechanism to compare results between institutions and to identify abnormalities while running routine clinical samples.',\n",

However, it is hypothesized that soluble OX40 (sOX40) in blood suppresses T‑cell activation by blocking the OX40/OX40L interaction. In the present study, the association between blood sOX40 levels and the clinical characteristics of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients was investigated. Blood was collected from 22 patients with advanced CRC. Blood sOX40 levels were determined by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression encoding OX40 or cytokines was analyzed by quantitative RT‑PCR. Blood sOX40 levels were positively correlated with the blood levels of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19‑9, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), C‑reactive protein (CRP) and soluble programmed cell death ligand‑1 (PD‑L1) in patients but negatively correlated with the blood levels of albumin. Blood sOX40 levels were not correlated with the mRNA expression of interferon (IFN)‑gamma, interleukin (IL)‑6, IL‑10 and IL‑4 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the patients and were not correlated with the frequency of programmed cell death‑1 (PD‑1) expressing CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ cells. Notably, according to both univariate and multivariate analyses, high blood sOX40 levels were significantly correlated with a reduced survival time in patients. Although activated Jurkat cells (a human T cell line) exhibited an upregulation of sOX40 production and OX40 mRNA expression, the OX40 mRNA expression of the PBMCs of patients was not correlated with blood sOX40 levels. High blood levels of sOX40 were correlated with a reduced survival time in patients with advanced CRC, possibly associated with the suppression of antitumor immunity by sOX40.',\n",
       " 'Epidemiological evidence points to a link between insulin resistance (IR) and breast cancer (BrCA). Insulin plays a role in CD8+ T cells (CD8T) differentiation and function and affects adipocytokines levels. CD8T activity in BrCA is associated with favorable outcome; while PD1 and TIM3 are markers of CD8T exhaustion and play critical roles in the negative regulation of T cell responses. Patients with (BrCA) have high expression levels of PD1 on circulating. Therefore, we hypothesized that BrCA and IR could affect PD1 and/or TIM3 expression on circulating CD8T. We determine PD1 and TIM3 expression on CD8T and analyze the relationship of CD8T phenotype with serum insulin and plasma adipocytokines levels in the different groups. We enrolled four groups of treatment-naive patients: women without neoplasms (Neo-)/without IR (IR-), Neo-/with IR (IR+), BrCa/IR- and BrCa/IR+. We found interactions between BrCA and IR with respect to TIM3 on naïve and central memory (CM) CD8T subsets. Furthermore, BrCA had a greater PD1\\u2009+\\u2009TIM3- CD8T frequency in CD8T subsets than Neo-. IR+ presented a significantly lower PD1\\u2009+\\u2009TIM3- frequency in CD8T subsets compare to Non-IR.

The increased expression of PD1 on different subsets of CD8T from BrCa patients is consistent with immunological tolerance, whereas IR has a contrary effect. IR could have a deleterious role in the activation of CD8T that can be relevant to new BrCa immunotherapy.',\n",

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine that contributes to diverse forms of renal injury. Therefore, we posited that TNF from T lymphocytes may contribute to NTN pathogenesis. Here, mice with T cell-specific deletion of TNF (TNF TKO) and wild-type (WT) controls were subjected to the NTN model. Compared to WTs, TNF TKO kidneys at day 14 of NTN have increased kidney injury and fibrosis. PD1+CD4+ T cell numbers and mRNA levels of IL-17A are elevated in NTN kidneys of TNF TKO mice, suggesting that augmented local Th17 responses in the TNF TKO kidney may exaggerate renal injury and fibrosis. In turn, we find increased accumulation of neutrophils in the TNF TKO kidneys during NTN. We conclude that TNF production in T lymphocytes mitigates NTN-induced kidney injury and fibrosis by inhibiting renal Th17 responses and infiltration of neutrophils.',\n",
       " 'With immunotherapy enjoying a rapid resurgence based on the achievement of durable remissions in some patients with agents that derepress immune function, commonly referred to as \"checkpoint inhibitors,\" enormous attention developed around the IDO1 enzyme as a metabolic mediator of immune escape in cancer. In particular, outcomes of multiple phase 1/2 trials encouraged the idea that small molecule inhibitors of IDO1 may improve patient responses to anti-PD1 immune checkpoint therapy. However, recent results from ECHO-301, the first large phase 3 trial to evaluate an IDO1-selective enzyme inhibitor (epacadostat) in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody (pembrolizumab) in advanced melanoma, showed no indication that epacadostat provided an increased benefit. Here we discuss several caveats associated with this failed trial. First is the uncertainty as to whether the target was adequately inhibited. In particular, there remains a lack of direct evidence regarding the degree of IDO1 inhibition within the tumor, and previous trial data suggest that sufficient drug exposure may not have been achieved at the dose tested in ECHO-301. Second, while there is a mechanistic rationale for the combination tested, the preclinical data were not particularly compelling. More efficacious combinations have been demonstrated with DNA damaging modalities which may therefore be a more attractive alternative. Third, as a highly selective IDO1 inhibitor, epacadostat was advanced aggressively despite preclinical genetic evidence of tumors bypassing IDO1 blockade. Indeed, a well-grounded literature starting in 2011 points to targeting strategies that account for both IDO and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase as more appealing directions to pursue, including dual inhibitors and inhibitors of nodal downstream effector pathways such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor blockade. Overall, the clinical readout from a single trial with significant limitations is by no means a definitive test for the field. While biomarker information yet to be gleaned from ECHO-301 may yet reveal useful information regarding IDO1 pathway drugs, better rationalized compounds and better rationalized trial designs will be important in the future to accurately gauge medical impact.',\n",

However, whether this subpopulation of PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells could be useful in predicting PDAC stage or prognosing survival is unknown. In this study, we used flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assay to analyze the expression of CD38 and CD101 in 183 clinical PDAC samples, including 84 of peripheral blood and 99 of surgical tissues. High coexpression of CD38/CD101 on peripheral PD-1+CD8+ T cells or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was found to be most significantly correlated with Tumor/Node/Metastasis (T/N/M) classification and clinical stage, in contrast PD-1+CD8+ T cells could not correlate with T classification. CD38/CD101 co-repression on TILs also correlated with the poor survival in these PDAC patient samples.

In this study, carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported ternary metallic NC comprising Cucluster-in-Pdcluster nanocrystal and surface decoration of atomic Pt clusters (14 wt %) is synthesized by using the wet chemical reduction method with sequence and reaction time controls. By annealing in H2 environment (H2/N2 = 9:1, 10 sccm) at 600 K for 2 h, specific activity of Cu@Pd/Pt is substantially improved by ∼2.0-fold as compared to that of the pristine sample and commercial Pt catalysts. By cross-referencing results of electron microscopic, X-ray spectroscopic, and electrochemical analyses, we demonstrated that reduction annealing turns ternary NC into complex of Cu3Pt alloy and Cu x Pd1-x alloy.

These experiments indicated lipid metabolism as a regulatory mechanism that increases melanoma immunogenicity by elevating antigen presentation, thereby increasing sensitivity to T\\xa0cell mediated killing both in vitro and in\\xa0vivo. Altogether, our proteomic analyses revealed association between the melanoma metabolic state and the response to immunotherapy, which can be the basis for future improvement of therapeutic response.',\n",

       " 'Many metastatic melanoma patients experience durable responses to anti-PD1 and/or anti-CTLA4; however, a significant proportion (over 50%) do not benefit from the therapies. In this study, we sought to assess pretreatment liquid biopsies for biomarkers that may correlate with response to checkpoint blockade. We measured the combinatorial diversity evenness of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire (the DE50, with low values corresponding to more clonality and lack of TCR diversity) in pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells from melanoma patients treated with anti-CTLA4 (n = 42) or anti-PD1 (n = 38) using a multi-N-plex PCR assay on genomic DNA (gDNA). A receiver operating characteristic curve determined the optimal threshold for a dichotomized analysis according to objective responses as defined by RECIST1.1. Correlations between treatment outcome, clinical variables, and DE50 were assessed in multivariate regression models and confirmed with Fisher exact tests. In samples obtained prior to treatment initiation, we showed that low DE50 values were predictive of a longer progression-free survival and good responses to PD-1 blockade, but, on the other hand, predicted a poor response to CTLA4 inhibition. Multivariate logistic regression models identified DE50 as the only independent predictive factor for response to anti-CTLA4 therapy (P = 0.03) and anti-PD1 therapy (P = 0.001). Fisher exact tests confirmed the association of low DE50 with response in the anti-CTLA4 (P = 0.041) and the anti-PD1 cohort (P = 0.0016). Thus, the evaluation of basal TCR repertoire diversity in peripheral blood, using a PCR-based method, could help predict responses to anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 therapies.',\n",

However, limited data are available on additional decidual Treg types and the mechanisms by which they are induced. This study investigated three distinct decidual CD4+ Treg types in healthy pregnancies with a regulatory phenotype and the ability to suppress T\\xa0cell responses: CD25HIFOXP3+, PD1HIIL-10+, and TIGIT+FOXP3dim. Moreover, co-culture of HLA-G+ EVTs or decidual macrophages with blood CD4+ T\\xa0cells directly increased the proportions of\\xa0CD25HIFOXP3+ Tregs compared to T\\xa0cells cultured alone.

However, PD1/PD-L1 signaling and its therapeutic significance remains largely unknown in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) cases with complex etiology. Methods: We investigated the expression and clinical significance of CD3 and PD1/PD-L1 in 320 ICC patients with different risk factors. In addition, we retrospectively analyzed 7 advanced ICC patients who were treated with PD1 inhibitor. Results: The cohort comprised 233 patients with HBV infection, 18 patients with hepatolithiasis, and 76 patients with undetermined risk factors. PD-L1 was mainly expressed in tumor cells, while CD3 and PD1 were expressed in infiltrating lymphocytes of tumor tissues. PD1/PD-L1 signals were activated in tumor tissues, and expression was positively correlated with HBV infection and lymph node invasion. More PD1+ T cells and higher PD-L1 expression were observed in tumor tissues of ICC patients with HBV infection compared to patients with hepatolithiasis or undetermined risk factors. More PD1+ T cells and/or high PD-L1 expression negatively impacted the prognosis of patients with HBV infection but not those with hepatolithiasis. Multivariate analysis showed PD1/PD-L1 expression was an independent indicator of ICC patient prognosis. Advanced ICC patients with HBV infection and less PD1+ T cells tended to have good response to anti-PD1 therapy. Conclusion: Hyperactivated PD1/PD-L1 signals in tumor tissues are a negative prognostic marker for ICCs after resection. HBV infection- and hepatolithiasis-related ICCs have distinct PD1/PD-L1 profiles. Further, PD1+ T cells could be used as a biomarker to predict prognosis and assay the efficiency of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in ICC patients with HBV infection.',\n",

       " \"The aim of the present study was to screen for biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD) using proteomics and bioinformatics approaches. PD patients were divided into three groups: Those without surgery (PD1 group); those who had undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery without electrode stimulation (PD2 group); and those who had undergone DBS surgery with 1 month of electrode stimulation (PD3 group). The non-Parkinson control group (CK group) was also involved. Quantitative proteomic analysis of human sera was performed through the use of tandem mass tag markers and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based techniques. For the proteins with quantitative information, a systematic bioinformatics analysis was then performed, including protein annotation, functional classification, functional enrichment and cluster analysis based on functional enrichment. Of the 739 proteins identified, quantitative information was available for 644. With regard to differential expression, 18 upregulated and 21 downregulated proteins were screened in the PD1/CK comparison group; 12 upregulated and 12 downregulated proteins in the PD2/PD1 comparison group; and 16 upregulated and 19 downregulated proteins in the PD3/PD2 comparison group. Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 154 (CCDC154) and tripartite motif-containing protein 3 (TRIM3) were key proteins involved in the molecular mechanisms of PD, participating in intracellular vesicle, ubiquitin protein ligase and transition metal ion-binding activities. After DBS surgery, desert hedgehog protein (DHH) was downregulated, whereas neuropilin-2 (NRP2) was upregulated; these participated in the ensheathment of neurons and the semaphorin receptor complex, respectively. The expression level of chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC1) was increased after 1 month of electrode stimulation following DBS. By combining proteomic approaches and LC-MS methods, significant proteins including CCDC154, TRIM3, DHH, NRP2 and CLIC1 were detected with high specificity and sensitivity. These may be used as novel biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD and the future development of treatments.\",\n",

       " \"Smad7, a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling, has been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we found that Smad7 mediates intestinal inflammation by limiting the PDL2/1-PD1 axis in dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+T cells. Smad7 deficiency in DCs promotes TGF-β responsiveness and the co-inhibitory molecules PDL2/1 on DCs, and it further imprints T\\xa0cell-PD1 signaling to promote Treg differentiation. DC-specific Smad7 deletion mitigates DSS-induced colitis by inducing CD103+PDL2/1+DCs and Tregs. In addition, Smad7 deficiency in CD4+T cells promotes PD1 and PD1-induced Tregs in\\xa0vitro. The transfer of Smad7-deficient CD4+T cells enhances Tregs in\\xa0vivo and protects against T\\xa0cell-mediated colitis. Furthermore, Smad7 antisense ameliorates DSS-induced UC, increasing TGF-β and PDL2/1-PD1 signaling. Enhancing PD1 signaling directly via Fc-fused PDL2/1 is also beneficial. Our results identify how Smad7 mediates intestinal inflammation and leverages these pathways therapeutically, providing additional strategies for IBD intervention.\",\n",

Its morbidity ranks 7th among all malignant tumors and its mortality ranks 6th. Postoperative adjuvant therapy after esophagectomy can significantly improve the overall survival rate of patients with locally resectable esophageal cancer. With the breakthrough and progress of immunotherapy, the possibility of cure of esophageal cancer is greatly improved. Some clinical trials have reported that programmed death 1 (PD1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) inhibitors alone, compared with traditional platinum-based chemotherapy, can benefit patients and effectively extend the overall survival period of patients. We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the comparison of the efficacy of immunotherapy (PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors) alone and traditional platinum-based chemotherapy, so as to provide a reliable basis for clinicians to formulate the best chemotherapy regimen for patients with esophageal cancer after esophagectomy.',\n",
       " 'The risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is markedly increased in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and remains elevated in those on anti-retroviral therapy (cART). Both the loss of immunoregulation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected cells, as well as chronic B-cell activation, are believed to contribute to the genesis of AIDS-related NHL (AIDS-NHL). However, the mechanisms that lead to AIDS-NHL have not been completely defined. A subset of B cells that is characterized by the secretion of IL10, as well as the expression of the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1/CD274), was recently described. These PD-L1+ B cells can exert regulatory function, including the dampening of T-cell activation, by interacting with the program cell death protein (PD1) on target cells. The role of PD-L1+ B cells in the development of AIDS-NHL has not been explored. We assessed B cell PD-L1 expression on B cells preceding AIDS-NHL diagnosis in a nested case-control study of HIV+\\u2009subjects who went on to develop AIDS-NHL, as well as HIV+ subjects who did not, using multi-color flow cytometry. Archival frozen viable PBMC were obtained from the UCLA Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). It was seen that the number of CD19+CD24++CD38++and CD19+PD-L1+cells was significantly elevated in cases 1-4 years prior to AIDS-NHL diagnosis, compared to controls, raising the possibility that these cells may play a role in the etiology of AIDS-NHL. Interestingly, most PD-L1+ expression on CD19+ cells was seen on CD19+CD24++CD38++ cells. In addition, we showed that HIV can directly induce PD-L1 expression on B cells through interaction of virion-associated CD40L with CD40 on B cells.',\n",
       " 'NADPH oxidases catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species and are involved in physio/pathological processes. NOX1 is highly expressed in colon cancer and promotes tumor growth. To investigate the efficacy of NOX1 inhibition as an anticancer strategy, tumors were grown in immunocompetent, immunodeficient, or NOX1-deficient mice and treated with the novel NOX1-selective inhibitor GKT771. GKT771 reduced tumor growth, lymph/angiogenesis, recruited proinflammatory macrophages, and natural killer T lymphocytes to the tumor microenvironment. GKT771 treatment was ineffective in immunodeficient mice bearing tumors regardless of their NOX-expressing status. Genetic ablation of host NOX1 also suppressed tumor growth. Combined treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD1 antibody had a greater inhibitory effect on colon carcinoma growth than each compound alone. In conclusion, GKT771 suppressed tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis and enhancing the recruitment of immune cells. The antitumor activity of GKT771 requires an intact immune system and enhances anti-PD1 antibody activity. Based on these results, we propose blocking of NOX1 by GKT771 as a potential novel therapeutic strategy to treat colorectal cancer, particularly in combination with checkpoint inhibition.',\n",
       " 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) is an integral component of the RAS pathway and a therapeutic target in RAS-driven cancers. Although tumor responses to MEK inhibition are rarely durable, MEK inhibitors have shown substantial activity and durable tumor regressions when combined with systemic immunotherapies in preclinical models of RAS-driven tumors. MEK inhibitors have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor T cell immunity, but little is known about the effects of MEK inhibition on other immune subsets, including B cells. We show here that treatment with a MEK inhibitor reduces B regulatory cells (Bregs) in vitro, and reduces the number of Bregs in tumor draining lymph nodes in a colorectal cancer model in vivo. MEK inhibition does not impede anti-tumor humoral immunity, and B cells contribute meaningfully to anti-tumor immunity in the context of MEK inhibitor therapy. Treatment with a MEK inhibitor is associated with improved T cell infiltration and an enhanced response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Together these data indicate that MEK inhibition may reduce Bregs while sparing anti-tumor B cell function, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor immunity.',\n",
       " 'Over the last decade anticancer treatment has experienced encouraging changes. One of the latest developments is immunotherapy, which is increasingly becoming a mainstay for the treatment of these malignancies. Unlike conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy enhances anti-tumor immune response by blocking inhibitory immune checkpoints, and allowing our own immune system to fight against the tumor cells, arising as a new and innovative mechanism of action. Therefore, although well tolerated, these drugs have a unique side effect profile and are known to cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Adverse effects of immunotherapy are most commonly observed in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung and endocrine systems. Less common toxicities may include neurological, haematological, cardiac, ocular or rheumatologic involvement. As far as we know, cancer patients are frequently seen in the Emergency Department due to treatment related toxicities, thus there is an increasing necessity to learn about this particular side effect profile given that they entail a different and unique management than that of classic chemotherapy drugs.',\n",

Unfortunately, many patients in practice are felt to be \"cisplatin-ineligible.\" Thus, it is vital that we develop treatment approaches and novel therapeutics for this population. We evaluate therapeutic alternatives to cisplatin-based treatment. For patients undergoing RC, there is no recommended alternative to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination therapy, and upfront RC or clinical trials are preferable. For patients receiving \"bladder-sparing\" radiation, concurrent radiosensitizing chemotherapies may be used, and several trials are also underway. For cisplatin-ineligible patients with mUC who are eligible for chemotherapy, carboplatin-based or split-dose cisplatin-based regimens may be employed. Pembrolizumab and atezolizumab offer options as first-line therapy for cisplatin-ineligible patients with high PD-L1 expression. The results of trials combining checkpoint inhibitors or platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors are eagerly awaited. For platinum or chemotherapy-ineligible patients with mUC, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as inhibitors of programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) are approved regardless of PD-L1 expression. However, given limited effectiveness of first-line PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy in tumors with low PD-L1 expression, trials in this space are critical.',\n",

However, only a small proportion of patients respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, so predictive biomarkers are needed. Here, based on DNA methylation profiles and the objective response rates (ORRs) of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition therapy, we identified 269 CpG sites and developed an initial CpG-based model by Lasso to predict ORRs. Notably, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), our model can produce better performance (AUC = 0.92) than both a model based on tumor mutational burden (TMB) (AUC = 0.77) and a previously reported TMB model (AUC = 0.71). In addition, most CpGs also have additional synergies with TMB, which can achieve a higher prediction accuracy when joined with TMB. Furthermore, we identified CpGs that are associated with TMB at the individual level. DNA methylation modules defined by protein networks, Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and ligand-receptor gene pairs are also associated with ORRs. This method suggested novel immuno-oncology targets that might be beneficial when combined with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Thus, DNA methylation studies might hold great potential for individualized PD1/PD-L1 blockade or combinatory therapy.',\n",
       " 'Nanostructured metal hydrides are able to efficiently detect hydrogen in optical sensors. In the literature, two nanostructured systems based on metal hydrides have been proposed for this purpose each with its own detection principle: continuous sub-100 nm thin films read out via optical reflectance/transmittance changes and nanoparticle arrays for which the detection relies on localized surface plasmon resonance. Despite their apparent similarities, their optical and structural response to hydrogen has never been directly compared. In response, for the case of Pd1- yAu y ( y = 0.15-0.30) alloys, we directly compare these two systems and establish that they are distinctively different. We show that the dissimilar optical response is not caused by the different optical readout principles but results from a fundamentally different structural response to hydrogen due to the different nanostructurings. The measurements empirically suggest that these differences cannot be fully accounted by surface effects but that the nature of the film-substrate interaction plays an important role and affects both the hydrogen solubility and the metal-to-metal hydride transition. In a broader perspective, our results establish that the specifics of nanoconfinement dictate the structural properties of metal hydrides, which in turn control the properties of nanostructured devices including the sensing characteristics of optical hydrogen sensors and hydride-based active plasmonic systems.',\n",

       " 'Cancer and autoimmune disease are closely related, and many therapeutic antibodies are widely used in clinics for the treatment of both diseases. Among them, the anti-CD20 antibody has proven to be effective against both lymphoid malignancy and autoimmune disease. Moreover, immune checkpoint blockade using the anti-PD1/PD-L1/CTLA4 antibody has improved the prognosis of patients with refractory solid tumors. At the same time, however, over-enhancement of immunoreaction can induce autoimmune reaction. Although anti-TNF antibody therapies represent a breakthrough in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, optimal management is required to control the serious associated issues, including development and progression of cancer, and it is becoming more and more important to control the immunoreaction. In addition, next-generation antibody therapeutics such as antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies, are anticipated to treat uncontrolled cancer and autoimmune disease. IL-7R signaling plays an important role in the development and progression of both lymphoid malignancy and autoimmune disease. In addition, abnormal homing activity and steroid resistance caused by IL-7R signaling may worsen prognosis. Therefore, anti-IL-7R targeting antibody therapies that enable suppression of such pathophysiological status have the potential to be beneficial for the treatment of both diseases. In this review, we discuss current antibody therapeutics in cancer and autoimmune disease, and describe a new therapeutic strategy for immunoregulation including IL-7R targeting antibodies.',\n",

Viruses too employ strategies to evade immune surveillance. Considering the role of both HLA-G and HPV in tumor growth and progression, it is pertinent to investigate the relationship between HLA-G and HPV in context of immune modulation in HNSCC. Method: A hospital based case-control study was conducted in histopathologically confirmed HNSCC tissues. HLA-G isoform expression and HPV association studies were carried out and mRNA levels of HLA-G, markers of proliferation and differentiation (ki-67, keratin 18, cyclin D1), immune checkpoint molecules (IL-10, PD-1. TGF-β), SOCS (SOCS1 and SOCS3) and pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ were determined. Results: Higher expression of HLA-G was noted in HPV positive tumors (5.14 fold, p = 0.002). HLA-G7 was the most frequent isoform (29/80) found in HNSCC particularly in HPV positive tumors (13/16). In HPV negative tumors, all the checkpoint molecules were upregulated along with pro-inflammatory IFN-γ. In contrast, in HPV positive tumors, IFN-γ expression was higher (2.12 fold) but levels of IL-10, PD-1, TGF-β, SOCS1 and SOCS3 were markedly lower (fold change of IL-10 = 0.37, PD1 = 0.41, TGF-β = 0.17, SOCS1 = 0.055, SOCS3 = 0.027). HPV positive tumors were more proliferative and differentiated with higher expression of ki-67 and keratin18 (6.25 fold, p = 0.079 and 10.62 fold, p = 0.009). Decreased expression of cyclin D1 was noted in HPV positive tumors (6.94 fold, p = 0.006) than HPV negative tumors (17.69 fold). Also, HLA-G7 expressing HPV positive tumors showed lowest expression of cyclin D1. Interestingly, SOCS showed normal expression in HLA-G7 expressing HPV negative tumors (1.2 and 1.4 fold). IFN-γ was downregulated in HPV positive tumors without HLA-G7 (0.31 fold). Conclusion: Our data suggests that SOCS were downregulated irrespective of HLA-G positivity and IFN- γ expression appeared to be mediated by HLA-G. SOCS are reported to have anti-tumor activity and also SOCS and soluble HLA-G are known to interfere with cell cycle progression. Hence, through regulating HLA-G expression, HPV positive tumors could mediate immune suppression by manipulating SOCS, IFN-γ, IL-10 and cyclin D1 pathways which needs further exploration.',\n",

Recent work identified memory-like CXCR5+ TCF1+ CD8+ T cells that sustain T cell responses during persistent infection and proliferate upon anti-PD1 treatment. Approaches to expand these cells are sought. We show that blockade of interferon type 1 (IFN-I) receptor leads to CXCR5+ CD8+ T cell expansion in an IL-27- and STAT1-dependent manner. IFNAR1 blockade promoted accelerated cell division and retention of TCF1 in virus-specific CD8+ T cells. We found that CD8+ T cell-intrinsic IL-27 signaling safeguards the ability of TCF1hi cells to maintain proliferation and avoid terminal differentiation or programmed cell death. Mechanistically, IL-27 endowed rapidly dividing cells with IRF1, a transcription factor that was required for sustained division in a cell-intrinsic manner. These findings reveal that IL-27 opposes IFN-I to uncouple effector differentiation from cell division and suggest that IL-27 signaling could be exploited to augment self-renewing T cells in chronic infections and cancer.',\n",

The control group included 19 healthy men and 18 women. Serum level of sPD-L1 significantly surpassed the control values in both patients with primary renal cancer (p<0.0001) and in patients examined during disease progression (p<0.05). In patients with benign kidney tumors, the level of this marker was significantly higher than in the control (p<0.05), but lower than in patients with renal cell carcinoma. The sPD-L1 level significantly increased with disease stage (p<0.001); it was higher in the presence of metastases in regional lymph nodes irrespective of their number (N1 or N2) than in the absence of metastases (N0); it was also increased in patients with distant metastases (M1) and patients with grade III-IV tumors in comparison with grade III-IV tumors (p<0.05).

Initial evaluation requires positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET/CT) and quantification of circulating EBV DNA. Radiotherapy alone is inadequate with frequent relapses. Anthracycline-containing regimens are ineffective. Regimens incorporating asparaginase are currently the standard. For stage I/II disease, combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy is recommended. For stage III/IV disease, asparaginase-containing regimens are needed. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is of limited efficacy, whereas allogeneic HSCT may be useful in patients with stage III/IV and relapsed diseases. Immunotherapy with antibodies against CD30, programmed cell death protein 1 and CD38 is promising.',\n",
       " 'Targeting of the PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway has rapidly gained acceptance as a therapeutic strategy for a growing number of malignancies. Testing for expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells and immune cells has been used as a companion or complementary test for drugs targeting the PD1/PD-L1 pathway. We evaluated the results of PD-L1 testing in a large reference lab cohort. Using Food and Drug Administration-approved methods and interpretive instructions for each individual test, 62,896 cases were evaluated for PD-L1 using antibody clone 22C3, 28-8, SP142, or SP263. Case data analyzed included test results and information on tumor location and clinical history. No clinical outcome information was available and no attempt was made to correlate PD-L1 results with any other tests performed. The following numbers of cases were evaluated: 22C3 with tumor proportion score [n\\u2009=\\u200952585], 22C3 with combined positive score [n\\u2009=\\u20092631], 28-8 [n\\u2009=\\u20094191], SP142 [n\\u2009=\\u2009850], and SP263 [n\\u2009=\\u200970]. In 22C3/tumor proportion score cases, the general results were as follows: negative 33.1% (n\\u2009=\\u200917,405), (low) expression 33.9% (n\\u2009=\\u200917,822), and high expression 29.5% (n\\u2009=\\u200915,486). In cases identified as metastatic, the results were as follows: negative 35.9% (n\\u2009=\\u20091411), (low) expression 30.8% (n\\u2009=\\u20091211), and high expression 30.7% (n\\u2009=\\u20091208). We found broad ranges of expression in tumor types with increasing positivity, as adenocarcinomas were reported as poorly differentiated, whereas squamous cell carcinomas showed more positivity as tumors were described as well-differentiated. The results of many individual tumor types were evaluated and showed, in general, high levels of positive expression. Practical challenges and observations of PD-L1 stain results and interpretation are also discussed.',\n",

       " 'Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) is an enzyme that degrades tryptophan into kynurenine and thereby induces immunosuppression. Like indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), TDO is considered as a relevant drug target to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. However, its role in various immunotherapy settings has not been fully characterized. Here, we described a new small-molecule inhibitor of TDO that can modulate kynurenine and tryptophan in plasma, liver, and tumor tissue upon oral administration. We showed that this compound improved the ability of anti-CTLA4 to induce rejection of CT26 tumors expressing TDO. To better characterize TDO as a therapeutic target, we used TDO-KO mice and found that anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1 induced rejection of MC38 tumors in TDO-KO, but not in wild-type mice. As MC38 tumors did not express TDO, we related this result to the high systemic tryptophan levels in TDO-KO mice, which lack the hepatic TDO needed to contain blood tryptophan. The antitumor effectiveness of anti-PD1 was abolished in TDO-KO mice fed on a tryptophan-low diet that normalized their blood tryptophan level. MC38 tumors expressed IDO1, which could have limited the efficacy of anti-PD1 in wild-type mice and could have been overcome in TDO-KO mice due to the high levels of tryptophan. Accordingly, treatment of mice with an IDO1 inhibitor improved the efficacy of anti-PD1 in wild-type, but not in TDO-KO, mice. These results support the clinical development of TDO inhibitors to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy of TDO-expressing tumors and suggest their effectiveness even in the absence of tumoral TDO expression.See article by Hoffmann et al., p. 19.',\n",

The contribution of the negative immune checkpoint V-domain Immunoglobulin-containing suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) to GCA pathology has not yet been studied. The aim of our study was to investigate if expression of VISTA and other IC molecules by peripheral blood (PB) immune cells is modulated in GCA and at the site of vascular inflammation. In addition, we assessed the effect of VISTA-Ig engagement on in vitro CD4+ T helper (Th) lineage differentiation. To this end, frequencies of monocytes expressing CD80/86, PD-L1, PD-L2, and VISTA were determined in blood samples from 30 GCA patients and 18 matched healthy controls by flow cytometry. In parallel, frequencies of CD4+ cells expressing CD28, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), PD-1, and VISTA were determined. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect VISTA, PD-1, and PD-L1-expressing cells in temporal artery biopsies (TABs) diagnostic of GCA. Furthermore, the effect of VISTA-Ig on in vitro CD4+ Th lineage differentiation in patients and controls was determined. Our study shows that frequencies of CD80/CD86+ and VISTA+ monocytes were decreased in treated GCA patients only. Moreover, proportions of PD-1+ and VISTA+ Th cells were significantly decreased in GCA patients. Clear infiltration of VISTA+, PD1+, and PD-L1+ cells was seen in GCA TABs. Finally, VISTA-Ig engagement failed to suppress Th1, Th17, and Tfh lineage development in GCA. Our results indicate that decreased expression of VISTA may facilitate development of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells in GCA.',\n",

Here, we identified an unrecognized macrophage subpopulation, which favors tumorigenesis. These macrophages express programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) in a constitutive manner and accumulates in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in advanced stage of the disease and is negatively associated with the survival of ESCC patients. The PD1+ tumor-associated macrophages (PD1+ TAMs) displayed surface pattern and function akin to M2: a substantial enhancement in CD206 and IL-10 expression; a specific reduction in HLA-DR, CD64, and IL-12 expression; and a significant increase in the ability to inhibit CD8+ T-cell proliferation. Triggering of PD1 signal is effective in increasing PD1+ TAM function. Moreover, exosomal HMGB1 obtained from tumors are efficient in triggering differentiation of monocytes into PD1+ TAMs, which display phenotypic and functional properties of M2. Overall, our work is the first finding to confirm that exosomal HMGB1 obtained from ESCC can successfully trigger clonal expansion of PD1+ TAM. Further, as the macrophages exhibit an M2-like surface profile and function, thereby creating conditions for development of ESCC.

       " 'Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD)/lymphomas in nonimmunosuppressed patients represent a unique entity and have been proposed to be related to immune senescence. Engagement of programmed cell death 1 (PD1) by its ligand programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) inhibits T-cell activation, and leads to T-cell exhaustion. In clinical trials, therapeutic antibodies that block the PD1-PDL1 axis have shown promising therapeutic activity in certain types of lymphomas. Although PD1/PDL1 has been extensively studied in variety of lymphomas, there are few reports characterizing their expression in EBV-positive LPD. As these group of patients are presumed to be associated with immunosenescence/immune dysregulation, we hypothesize that the immune checkpoint pathway might be relevant in this entity. We explored the expression of PD1, PDL1 and its clinicopathologic association in 6 patients with a total of 8 independent specimens of EBV-positive LPD/lymphomas. We also applied proximity assay, a novel technique, which can identify intermolecular interaction, to evaluate physical interaction or in situ engagement of PD1 and PDL1. We found that the malignant cells in the EBV-positive LPDs express PDL1. PD1-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes can be seen in these tumors. Proximity assay suggests there is active engagement between PD1 and PDL1. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the utility of proximity assay to test the active engagement between PD1 and PDL1 in lymphomas. As some EBV-positive LPDs were positive for PDL1, this subgroup of EBV-positive LPDs might be suitable for PD1/PDL1 antibody therapies.',\n",
       " 'Asthma and obesity present rising incidence, and their concomitance is a reason for concern, as obese individuals are usually resistant to conventional asthma treatments and have more exacerbation episodes. Obesity affects several features in the lungs during asthma onset, shifting the T helper type 2 (Th2)/eosinophilic response towards a Th17/neutrophilic profile. Moreover, those individuals can present reduced atopy and delayed cytokine production. However, the impact of obesity on follicular helper T (Tfh) cells and B cells that could potentially result in antibody production disturbances are still unclear. Therefore, we aimed to assess the peripheral response to ovalbumin (OVA) in a concomitant model of obesity and asthma. Pulmonary allergy was induced, in both lean and obese female BALB/c mice, through OVA sensitizations and challenges. Mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) and spleen were processed for immunophenotyping. Lung was used for standard allergy analysis. Obese-allergic mice produced less anti-OVA IgE and more IgG2a than lean-allergic mice. Dendritic cells (CD11c+ \\xa0MHCIIhigh ) expressed less CD86 and more PDL1 in obese-allergic mice compared with lean-allergic mice, in the MLNs.

Nowadays, immunotherapy appears to play a leading role in the treatment of various tumor types. Characterization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) and immune checkpoints can possibly help identify new immunotherapeutic targets for DTs. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 33 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from DT samples to characterize the TME and the immune checkpoint expression profile. We stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, FoxP3, CD45RO, CD56, CD68, NKp46, granzyme B, CD27, CD70, PD1 and PD-L1. We investigated the expression of the markers in the tumoral stroma, as well as at the periphery of the tumor. We found that most of the tumors showed organization of lymphocytes into lymphoid aggregates at the periphery of the tumor, strongly resembling tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). The tumor expressed a significant number of memory T cells, both at the periphery and in the tumoral stroma. In the lymphoid aggregates, we also recognized a significant proportion of regulatory T cells. The immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1 was negative on the tumor cells in almost all samples. On the other hand, PD1 was partially expressed in lymphocytes at the periphery of the tumor. To conclude, we are the first to show that DTs display a strong immune infiltration at the tumor margins, with formation of lymphoid aggregates. Moreover, we demonstrated that there is no PD-L1-driven immune suppression present in the tumor cells.',\n",
       " \"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now a standard of care in the treatment of many cancers leading to durable responses in patients with metastatic disease. These agents are generally well tolerated but may lead to the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

Although the most common irAEs are rarely severe, some of them may be associated with great morbidity and even become life-threatening. The rate of occurrence, type and severity of irAEs may vary with the type of ICI; thus, grade 3 and 4 irAEs are reported in more than 55% of patients treated with the combination of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg.

       " 'Given advancements in cancer immunity, cancer treatment has gained breakthrough developments. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, are the most promising drugs in the field and have been approved to treat various types of cancer, such as metastatic melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma. However, whether PD-1 inhibitors should be administered to renal transplant patients with advanced cancer remains unclear because the T-cells produced after administration of these inhibitors act against not only tumor antigens but also donor alloantigens. Thus, the use of PD-1 inhibitors in kidney-transplanted patients with advanced cancer is limited on account of the high risk of graft failure due to acute rejection. Hence, finding optimal treatment regimens to enhance the tumor-specific T-cell response and decrease T-cell-mediated alloreactivity after administration of a PD-1 inhibitor is necessary. Thus far, no recommendations for the use of PD-1 inhibitors to treat cancer in renal transplant patients are yet available, and very few cases reporting kidney-transplanted patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors are available in the literature. Therefore, in this work, we review the published cases and suggest feasible approaches for renal transplant patients with advanced malignancy treated by a PD-1 inhibitor. Of the 22 cases we obtained, four patients maintained intact grafts without tumor progression after treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor. Among these patients, one maintained steroid dose before initiation of anti-PD1, two received immunosuppressive regimens with low-dose steroid and calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-elimination with sirolimus before initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy, and one received combined anti-PD-1, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and chemotherapy with unchanged immunosuppressive regimens. mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and anti-VEGF may act as regulators of tumor-specific and allogenic T-cells. However, more studies are necessary to explore the optimal therapy and ensure the safety and efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in kidney-transplanted patients.',\n",

The roles of PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in TNBC clinicopathological behaviors and patients' survival outcomes remain unclear. Methods: TNBC (108 cases) patients with at least 5-year follow-up were analyzed for PD-L1 expression and TILs by immunohistochemistry. We also analyzed the relationships between PD-L1 expression, TILs and clinicopathological characteristics. Furthermore, we explored the effect of PD-L1 expression and TILs on prognosis as illustrated by disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The expression of PD-L1 was related to more aggressive clinicopathological behaviors in TNBC patients including a larger tumor size, higher incidence of PL-1-ALN, more frequent distant metastasis, and a reduced disease-free survival. In contrast, patients with high-level TILs showed less aggressive disease progression hence a better prognosis compared to patients with low-level TILs. Among patients with high-level TILs, PD-L1 expression was correlated with adverse prognosis. Conclusions: Expression of PD-L1 and low-level TILs in TNBC patients were associated with adverse clinical outcomes. However, the positive impact of high-level TILs was attenuated by PD-L1 expression. Our results suggest potential biomarkers for a selection of indicated cases in the TNBC patients for anti-PD-L1/anti-PD1 immunotherapy.\",\n",

Treatment with selective anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been a revolution in the therapeutic scenario of several cancer types, with the highest clinical efficacy in melanoma and in lung cancer. Colorectal cancer is one of the tumours in which immunotherapy has been shown less effective. Whereas in deficient mismatch repair (MMR) or in highly microsatellite instable (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer there is clear clinical evidence for a therapeutic role of immune checkpoint inhibitors, the vast majority of patients with proficient MMR or with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours do not benefit from immunotherapy. Defining the molecular mechanisms for immunogenicity in metastatic colorectal cancer is needed in order to develop predictive biomarkers and effective therapeutic combination strategies. A major challenge will be to identify, among the heterogeneous spectrum of this disease, those patients with specific tumour and tumour infiltrating stroma molecular and functional characteristics, that could be effectively treated with immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the role of immune response in the context of metastatic colorectal cancer. We summarize the available clinical data with the use of anti PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs as single agents or in combination with anti CTLA-4 mAbs in MSI-H patients.

       " 'We investigate here how APRIL impacts immune regulatory T cells and directly contributes to the immunosuppressive multiple myeloma (MM) bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. First, APRIL receptor TACI expression is significantly higher in regulatory T cells (Tregs) than conventional T cells (Tcons) from the same patient, confirmed by upregulated Treg markers, i.e., Foxp3, CTLA-4. APRIL significantly stimulates proliferation and survival of Tregs, whereas neutralizing anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) inhibit these effects. Besides TACI-dependent induction of cell cycle progression and anti-apoptosis genes, APRIL specifically augments Foxp3, IL-10, TGFβ1, and PD-L1 in Tregs to further enhance Treg-inhibited Tcon proliferation. APRIL further increases MM cell-driven Treg (iTreg) via TACI-dependent proliferation associated with upregulated IL-10, TGFβ1, and CD15s in iTreg, which further inhibits Tcons. Osteoclasts producing APRIL and PD-L1 significantly block Tcon expansion by iTreg generation, which is overcome by combined treatment with anti-APRIL and anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs. Finally, APRIL increases IL-10-producing B regulatory cells (Bregs) via TACI on BM Bregs of MM patients. Taken together, these results define novel APRIL actions via TACI on Tregs and Bregs to promote MM cell survival, providing the rationale for targeting APRIL/TACI system to alleviate the immunosuppressive BM milieu and improve patient outcome in MM.',\n",

       " 'The overall survival rate of patients with osteosarcoma has remained stagnant at 15-30% for several decades. Although immunotherapy has revolutionized the oncology field, largely attributed to the success of immune-checkpoint blockade, the durability and efficacy of anti-PD1 (programmed cell death protein 1) mAb vary across different malignancies. Among the major reasons for tumor resistance to this immune checkpoint therapy is the absence of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. However, the presence of intratumor exhausted PD1hi T cells also contributes to insensitivity to anti-PD1 treatment. In this study, we established the osteosarcoma mouse tumor model resistant to anti-PD1 mAb that harbored PD1hi T cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis of tumor infiltrating leukocytes after treatment was used as a screening platform to identify agents that could re-sensitize T cells to anti-PD1 mAb. Results showed that anti-CD40 mAb treatment converted PD1hi T cells to PD1lo T cells, reversing phenotypic T cell exhaustion and sensitizing anti-PD1 refractory tumors to respond to anti-PD1 mAb. Results also showed that intratumor Treg presented with a less activated and attenuated suppressive phenotype after anti-CD40 mAb treatment. Our study provides proof of concept to systematically identify immune conditioning agents, which are able to convert PD1hi T cells to PD1lo T cells, with clinical implications in the treatment against refractory osteosarcoma to anti-PD1 mAb.',\n",

       " 'Discovery of therapeutic antibodies is a field of intense development, where immunization of rodents remains a major source of antibody candidates. However, high orthologue protein sequence homology between human and rodent species disfavors generation of antibodies against functionally conserved binding epitopes. Chickens are phylogenetically distant from mammals. Since chickens generate antibodies from a restricted set of germline genes, the possibility of adapting the Symplex antibody discovery platform to chicken immunoglobulin genes and combining it with high-throughput humanization of antibody frameworks by \"mass complementarity-determining region grafting\" was explored. Hence, wild type chickens were immunized with an immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death 1 (PD1) antigen, and a repertoire of 144 antibodies was generated. The PD1 antibody repertoire was successfully humanized, and we found that most humanized antibodies retained affinity largely similar to that of the parental chicken antibodies. The lead antibody Sym021 blocked PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligand binding, resulting in elevated T-cell cytokine production in vitro. Detailed epitope mapping showed that the epitope recognized by Sym021 was unique compared to the clinically approved PD1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab. Moreover, Sym021 bound human PD1 with a stronger affinity (30 pM) compared to nivolumab and pembrolizumab, while also cross-reacting with cynomolgus and mouse PD1. This enabled direct testing of Sym021 in the syngeneic mouse in vivo cancer models and evaluation of preclinical toxicology in cynomolgus monkeys. Preclinical in vivo evaluation in various murine and human tumor models demonstrated a pronounced anti-tumor effect of Sym021, supporting its current evaluation in a Phase 1 clinical trial.

In order to further improve the efficiency of immunotherapy, novel immune checkpoint inhibitors needed to be developed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy kidney tissues and ccRCC tissues had been found from GSE68417 by GEO2R online analysis tool. Correlation analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were based on UALCAN database. Analyses of the outcome of anti-PD1 treatment had been found from GSE67501 dataset. At first, 9 genes with higher expression were associated with shorter overall survival time. More importantly, higher expression of LGALS1 was correlated with a profitable outcome of anti-PD1 treatment and the combined the expression level of PD-L1 and LGALS1 together could more efficiently predict the outcome of anti-PD1 treatment than using PD-L1 alone. At last, the genes which correlated with LGALS1 expression in ccRCC patients were enriched in TNF alpha Signaling Pathway which is mainly correlated with T cell apoptosis and survival. Together, these suggest LGALS1 could be a potential immune checkpoint, which could promote tumor progression through affecting T cell survival.',\n",

Understanding how checkpoint inhibitors may augment established chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimens or other immunotherapies like oncolytic viruses may lead to better clinical outcomes measured by improved efficacy with reduced toxicity.

       " 'The novel therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors hold great promises for patients with chronic virus infections and cancers. This is based mainly on the partial reversal of the exhausted phenotype of antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTL). Recently, we have shown that the restoration of HIV-specific T cell function depends on the HIV infection stage of an infected individual. Here we aimed to answer two fundamental questions: (i) Can one estimate growth parameters for the HIV-specific proliferative responsiveness upon PD-L1 blockade ex vivo? (ii) Can one use these parameter estimates to predict clinical benefit for HIV-infected individuals displaying diverse infection phenotypes? To answer these questions, we first analyzed HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8 T cell proliferation by time-resolved CFSE assays and estimated the effect of PD-L1 blockade on division and death rates, and specific precursor frequencies. These values were then incorporated into a model for CTL-mediated HIV control and the effects on CTL frequencies, viral loads and CD4 T cell counts were predicted for different infection phenotypes. The biggest absolute increase in CD4 T cell counts was in the group of slow progressors while the strongest reduction in virus loads was observed in progressor patients. These results suggest a significant clinical benefit only for a subgroup of HIV-infected individuals. However, as PD1 is a marker of lymphocyte activation and expressed on several lymphocyte subsets including also CD4 T cells and B cells, we subsequently examined the multiple effects of anti-PD-L1 blockade beyond those on CD8 T cells. This extended model then predicts that the net effect on HIV load and CD4 T cell number depends on the interplay between positive and negative effects of lymphocyte subset activation. For a physiologically relevant range of affected model parameters, PD-L1 blockade is likely to be overall beneficial for HIV-infected individuals.',\n",

In a single-center study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a combination therapy with CD19 CAR-T cells and an anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) in patients with relapsed/refractory B-NHL. A total of 11 patients with refractory/relapsed B-NHL were recruited and subsequently received CD19 CAR-T cells and nivolumab. The primary end points were safety and feasibility. The infusions were safe, and no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Grade 1 or 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in 25% (3/11) and 50% (6/11) of the patients, respectively, and only one patient (1/11) experienced neurotoxicity. The objective response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate were 81.81% (9/11) and 45.45% (5/11), respectively. The median follow-up time was 6 (1~15) months.

       " 'The recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in the liver delineates the transition from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis. We found that in steatohepatitis, γδT cells are recruited to the liver by CCR2, CCR5, and NOD2 signaling and are skewed towards an IL-17A+ phenotype in an ICOS-ICOSL dependent manner. γδT cells exhibit a distinct Vγ4+ , PD1+ , Ly6C+ CD44+ phenotype in steatohepatitis. Moreover, γδT cells upregulate both CD1d, which is necessary for lipid-based antigens presentation, and the free fatty acid receptor CD36. γδT cells are stimulated to express IL-17A by palmitic acid and CD1d ligation. Deletion, depletion, and targeted interruption of γδT cell recruitment protects against diet-induced steatohepatitis and accelerates disease resolution. We demonstrate that hepatic γδT cells exacerbate steatohepatitis, independent of IL-17 expression, by mitigating conventional CD4+ T cell expansion and modulating their inflammatory program via CD1d-dependent VEGF expression.',\n",
       " 'Combined checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD1/PD-L1) with traditional clinical therapies can be hampered by side effects and low tumour-therapeutic outcome, hindering broad clinical translation. Here we report a combined tumour-therapeutic modality based on integrating nanosonosensitizers-augmented noninvasive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy. All components of the nanosonosensitizers (HMME/R837@Lip) are clinically approved, wherein liposomes act as carriers to co-encapsulate sonosensitizers (hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME)) and immune adjuvant (imiquimod (R837)). Using multiple tumour models, we demonstrate that combining nanosonosensitizers-augmented SDT with anti-PD-L1 induces an anti-tumour response, which not only arrests primary tumour progression, but also prevents lung metastasis. Furthermore, the combined treatment strategy offers a long-term immunological memory function, which can protect against tumour rechallenge after elimination of the initial tumours.

The results showed that PD1-1 is an inulin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 2.6 kDa and is composed of glucose (52.39%), and mannose (45.41%). Glycosidic linkage analysis demonstrated that PD1-1 contains terminal α-d-Man/Glcp-(1→ and →1)-β-d-Man/Glcf-(2→ glycosidic linkage conformations.

Programed death ligand 1 PD-L1, expressed on cancer cell membranes also blocks the cytotoxic activity of PD1+ cytotoxic lymphocytes. Materials and Methods: We assessed the immunohistochemical detection of these immune-tolerance related markers in a series of 98 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) treated with surgery. The Tumor Infiltration Lymphocyte TIL density (mean number per x400 optical field) and the percentage of FOXP3+ TILs were assessed. Results: PD-L1 expression was directly linked with the TIL density (p\\u2009=\\u20090.01) and with the extent of infiltration with FOXP3+ TILs, named as the FIL-score (p\\u2009=\\u20090.01). FIL-score was significantly higher in stage I disease (p\\u2009=\\u20090.04). IL6 expression was linked with high TIL-score. A low TIL-score, characterizing immune deficient tumors defined a significantly poorer prognosis subgroup of patients (p\\u2009=\\u20090.03). Stratification of these tumors according to the FIL-score showed that FOXP3 expression by TILs correlated with an even a poorer prognosis in univariate (p\\u2009=\\u20090.007; median survival 14 vs. 44\\u2009months, respectively) and in multivariate analysis (p\\u2009=\\u20090.01, hazard ratio 4.3). Conclusion: Tumor stroma infiltration by FOXP3+ Tregs is an early event in the progression of NSCLC. Low lymphocytic infiltration defines poor prognosis, which becomes worse when the small numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes characterizing these tumors contain FOXP3 + Tregs. Furthermore, the direct association of FOXP3+ Treg infiltration density with PD-L1 expression by cancer cells implies a co-ordinated immune-suppressive activity in NSCLC.',\n",

In this prospective proof-of-principle study we sought to determine the dynamic alterations in natural killer (NK), NK-T, and T cells, including maturation and activating/inhibitory repertoire associated with MRDpos versus MRDneg status after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and during lenalidomide-based maintenance therapy. Of the 46MM patients enrolled, 36 had bone marrow MRD assessment 60+ days post-ASCT, 30 had longitudinal blood immunotyping during maintenance (pretherapy and after cycles 1, 3, and 6), and 20 had both MRD assessment and longitudinal immunotyping. Multicolor flow cytometry was used for MRD and immunotyping. Although the absolute number of NK cells was significantly lower in patients with MRDpos response, phenotypically NK cells in these patients displayed higher expression of activating receptors KIRDS4 and decreased expression of inhibitory molecules NKG2A compared with the MRDneg group. Furthermore, we observed significantly lower frequencies of T cells displaying KIR3DL1 in MRDpos versus MRDneg patients. Longitudinal immunotyping during lenalidomide maintenance showed loss of mature NK effector function, augmentation of NK-T effector function, and acquisition of PD1 independent anergic state. Our findings also suggest skewing of T cells toward an exhausted state during the maintenance phase in MRDpos patients. Put together, these observations provide a distinctive signature for MRDneg and MRDpos groups. These data support exploration of immune profiling in prospective clinical trials according to MRD-defined responses to identify patients that may benefit from maintenance intensification/modification or maintenance withdrawal.',\n",

Methods: Here, we developed a library construction method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Extension Assembly and Self-Ligation (named \"EASeL\") to construct a large VNAR antibody library with a size of 1.2\\xa0×\\xa01010 from six naïve adult nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum). Results: The next-generation sequencing analysis of 1.19 million full-length VNARs revealed that this library is highly diversified because it covers all four classical VNAR types (Types I-IV) including 11% of classical Type I and 57% of classical Type II. About 30% of the total VNARs could not be categorized as any of the classical types. The high variability of complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 length and cysteine numbers are important for the diversity of VNARs. To validate the use of the shark VNAR library for antibody discovery, we isolated a panel of VNAR phage binders to cancer therapy-related antigens, including glypican-3, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and programmed cell death-1 (PD1). Additionally, we identified binders to viral antigens that included the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike proteins. The isolated shark single-domain antibodies including Type I and Type II VNARs were produced in Escherichia coli and validated for their antigen binding. A Type II VNAR (PE38-B6) has a high affinity (Kd\\xa0=\\xa010.1\\xa0nM) for its antigen. Conclusions: The naïve nurse shark VNAR library is a useful source for isolating single-domain antibodies to a wide range of antigens.

       " 'Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a crucial role in maintaining self-tolerance and resolution of immune responses by employing multifaceted immunoregulatory mechanisms. However, Treg cells readily infiltrate into the tumor microenvironment (TME) and dampen anti-tumor immune responses, thereby becoming a barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy. There has been a substantial expansion in the development of novel immunotherapies targeting various inhibitory receptors (IRs), such as CTLA4, PD1 and LAG3, but these approaches have mechanistically focused on the elicitation of anti-tumor responses. However, enhanced inflammation in the TME could also play a detrimental role by facilitating the recruitment, stability and function of Treg cells by up-regulating chemokines that promote Treg cell migration, and/or increasing inhibitory cytokine production. Furthermore, IR blockade may enhance Treg cell function and survival, thereby serving as a resistance mechanism against effective immunotherapy. Given that Treg cells are comprised of functionally and phenotypically heterogeneous sub-populations that may alter their characteristics in a context-dependent manner, it is critical to identify unique molecular pathways that are preferentially used by intratumoral Treg cells. In this review, we discuss markers that serve to identify certain Treg cell subsets, distinguished by chemokine receptors, IRs and cytokines that facilitate their migration, stability and function in the TME. We also discuss how these Treg cell subsets correlate with the clinical outcome of patients with various types of cancer and how they may serve as potential TME-specific targets for novel cancer immunotherapies.',\n",

       " 'Increased frequencies of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) are associated with gut lymphoid tissue fibrosis and dysfunction which, in turn, contribute to disease progression in chronic simian immunodeficiency virus/human immunodeficiency virus (SIV/HIV) infection. Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), which drain the large and small intestine, are critical sites for the induction and maintenance of gut mucosal immunity. However, the dynamics of Tregs in MLNs are not well understood due to the lack of accessibility to these tissues in HIV-infected individuals. Here, the dynamics of Tregs in blood and MLNs were assessed in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) following early antiretroviral drug (ARV) initiation. Early ARV initiation reduced T-cell immune activation, as assessed by HLA-DR/CD39 expression, and prevented the depletion of memory CCR6+ Th17 cells in both blood and MLNs. Untreated animals showed higher frequencies of Tregs, CD39+ Tregs, thymic Tregs, and new memory CD4 populations sharing similarity with Tregs as CTLA4+ PD1- and CTLA4+ PD1- FoxP3+ T cells. Despite early ARV treatment, the frequencies of these Treg subsets remained unchanged within the MLNs and, in contrast to blood normalization, the Th17/Treg ratio remained distorted in MLNs. Furthermore, our results highlighted that the expressions of IDO-1, TGFβ1 and collagen-1 mRNA remained unchanged in MLN of ARV-treated RMs. ARV interruption did not affect T-cell immune activation and Th17/Treg ratios in MLN. Altogether, our data demonstrated that early ARV initiation within the first few days of SIV infection is unable to reduce the frequencies and homing of various subsets of Tregs within the MLNs which, in turn, may result in tissue fibrosis, impairment in MLN function, and HIV persistence.IMPORTANCE Tregs contribute to SIV/HIV disease progression by inhibition of antiviral specific responses and effector T-cell proliferation. Tregs also cause tissue fibrosis via transforming growth factor β1 production and collagen deposition, which are associated with microbial translocation and generalized immune activation. Early ARV initiation upon viral exposure is recommended globally and results in improved immune function recovery and reduced viral persistence. Here, using an acute SIV infection model of rhesus macaques, we demonstrated for the first time that despite clear improvements in mucosal CD4 T cells, in contrast to blood, Treg frequencies in MLNs remained elevated following early ARV initiation. The particular Th17/Treg balance observed in MLNs can contribute, in part, to the maintenance of mucosal fibrosis during suppressive ARV treatment. Our results provide a better understanding of gut mucosal immune dynamics following early ARV initiation. These findings suggest that Treg-based treatments could serve as a novel immunotherapeutic approach to decrease gut mucosal damage during SIV/HIV infections.',\n",
       " 'Activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is known to foster innate and adaptive immune responses and thus improve immune-mediated control of malignant disease. Lefitolimod is a potent TLR9 agonist without chemical modification developed for immunotherapeutic strategies. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a crucial requirement for the response to various immunotherapies: Immunogenic (\"hot\") tumors, characterized by their T cell-infiltrated TME, respond better compared to non-immunogenic (\"cold\") tumors. It has been speculated that the mode-of-action of lefitolimod provides the necessary signals for activation of immune cells, their differentiation into anti-tumor effector cells and their recruitment into the TME. We investigated the effect of lefitolimod on TME, and its potency to induce synergistic anti-tumor effects when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitory antibodies (CPI) in a murine model. Indeed, we could show that treatment with single-agent lefitolimod beneficially modulated the TME, via infiltration of activated CD8+ cells and a shift in the macrophage population toward M1 phenotype. The result was a pronounced anti-tumor effect correlated with the magnitude of infiltrated immune cells and tumor-specific T cell responses. In line with this, lefitolimod led to persistent anti-tumor memory in the EMT-6 model after tumor re-challenge. This was accompanied by an increase of tumor-specific T cell responses and cross-reactivity against different tumor cells. Lefitolimod clearly augmented the limited anti-tumor effect of the CPI anti-PD1 in an A20 and anti-PD-L1 in a CT26 model. These properties of potent immune surveillance reactivation render lefitolimod an ideal candidate as therapeutic agent for immuno-oncology, e.g. improving CPI strategies.',\n",
       " 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been widely studied in immunotherapy. Although antibodies have been more widely used to block immune checkpoints, DNA aptamers have unique advantages for this purpose. Here, we designed a DNA polyaptamer hydrogel that can be precisely cut by Cas9/sgRNA for programmed release of an immune checkpoint-blocking DNA aptamer. As a representative immune checkpoint inhibitor, we used a PD-1 DNA aptamer. Rolling-circle amplification was used to generate a hydrogel comprising DNA with PD-1 aptamer and an sgRNA-targeting sequence. When mixed with Cas9/sgRNA, the PD-1 DNA aptamer hydrogel (PAH) lost its gel property and liberated the PD-1 aptamer sequence. The precise Cas9/sgRNA-mediated release of the PD-1 DNA aptamer, which was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, was found to effectively activate the cytokine-secretion function of splenocytes. In vivo, molecular imaging revealed that PD-1 DNA polyaptamer hydrogel co-injected with Cas9/sgRNA (Cas9/PAH) remained at the injection site longer than free aptamer and yielded significantly higher antitumor effects and survival than hydrogel or free aptamer. Moreover, increased immune cell filtration was observed at tumor tissues treated with Cas9/PAH. These results suggest that our Cas9/sgRNA-edited immune checkpoint-blocking aptamer hydrogel has strong potential for anticancer immunotherapy.',\n",

       " 'Endowing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T\\xa0cells with additional potent functionalities holds strong potential for improving their antitumor activity. However, because potency could be deleterious without control, these additional features need to be tightly regulated. Immune pathways offer a wide array of tightly regulated genes that can be repurposed to express potent functionalities in a highly controlled manner. Here, we explore this concept by repurposing TCR, CD25 and PD1, three major players of the T\\xa0cell activation pathway. We insert the CAR into the TCRα gene (TRACCAR), and IL-12P70 into either IL2Rα or PDCD1 genes. This process results in transient, antigen concentration-dependent IL-12P70 secretion, increases TRACCAR T\\xa0cell cytotoxicity and extends survival of tumor-bearing mice. This gene network repurposing strategy can be extended to other cellular pathways, thus paving the way for generating smart CAR T\\xa0cells able to integrate biological inputs and to translate them into therapeutic outputs in a highly regulated manner.',\n",
       " 'Checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapies that target cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD1) pathway have achieved impressive success in the treatment of different cancer types. Yet, only a subset of patients derive clinical benefit. It is thus critical to understand the determinants driving response, resistance and adverse effects. In this Review, we discuss recent work demonstrating that immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy is affected by a combination of factors involving tumour genomics, host germline genetics, PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1) levels and other features of the tumour microenvironment, as well as the gut microbiome. We focus on recently identified molecular and cellular determinants of response. A better understanding of how these variables cooperate to affect tumour-host interactions is needed to optimize the implementation of precision immunotherapy.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND TCL-based immunotherapy has been applied in the field cancer therapy. However, it is un clear whether this therapy can be used to treat triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and different TNBC cells have distinct responses to this therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present work, we conducted 2 different TCL-based immunotherapies to treat TNBC and compared their anti-tumor effect on 4 TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, HCC1937, and HCC1187. RESULTS Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) activated by TCL and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) stimulated with TCL-loaded DC demonstrated the ability to kill TNBC cells in vitro, but the killing efficiency of PBL was much higher than that of PBMC. In vivo, PBL stimulated with TCL-loaded DC can also stop the growth of TNBC tumors in mice. HCC1187 and MDA-MD-231 best respond to TCL-based immunotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. The response of HCC1937 was weaker, and that of MDA-MB-436 was lowest among the 4 cell lines. Total mRNA microarray analysis of TNBC cells showed that PDL-1 mRNA expression in HCC1937 and MDA-MD-436 cells was higher than in the other 2 TNBC cell lines, and that of MDA-MB-436 was higher than that of HCC1937. PD1 blocking can decrease the apoptosis rate. These results show that different contents of PDL-1 in TCL, by interacting with PD expression on lymphocytes, can induce different ratios of lymphocyte apoptosis, and then result in distinct response of the 4 TNBC cell lines to TCL-based immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS TCL-based immunotherapy has discrepant anti-tumor efficiency in different TNBC cell lines by PDL-1/PD interaction, providing the theoretical basis of TCL-based immunotherapy in TNBC.',\n",

Before anti-PD1 treatment, 12, 9 and 12 patients received one, two, and three or more therapies, respectively. Objective response, survival rate, and clinical adverse events were evaluated by the revised RECIST criteria (version 1.1). The median patient age was 68 years (range: 37-79). In total, 14 (42%) patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 while 17 (52%) and two (6%) had an ECOG PS of 1 and 2 or higher, respectively. One (3%), 24 (73%) and eight (24%) were classified as having favorable, intermediate, and poor risk, respectively. The median follow-up duration after nivolumab initiation was 26 months (range: 1-131). The median progression-free and overall survival were 10.3 months and 45.9 months, respectively. Nivolumab was associated with a disease control rate of 58%, with an objective response of 24% (complete response, 1; partial response, 7; stable disease, 11; progressive disease, 10; not assessed, 4).

       " 'Elicitation of tumor cell killing by CD8+ T cells is an effective therapeutic approach for cancer. In addition to using immune checkpoint blockade to reinvigorate existing but unresponsive tumor-specific T cells, alternative therapeutic approaches have been developed, including stimulation of polyclonal T cell cytolytic activity against tumors using bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) molecules that simultaneously engage the TCR complex and a tumor-associated Ag. BiTE molecules are efficacious against hematologic tumors and are currently being explored as an immunotherapy for solid tumors. To understand mechanisms regulating BiTE molecule--mediated CD8+ T cell activity against solid tumors, we sought to define human CD8+ T cell populations that efficiently respond to BiTE molecule stimulation and identify factors regulating their cytolytic activity. We find that human CD45RA+CCR7- CD8+ T cells are highly responsive to BiTE molecule stimulation, are enriched in genes associated with cytolytic effector function, and express multiple unique inhibitory receptors, including leukocyte Ig-like receptor B1 (LILRB1). LILRB1 and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) were found to be expressed by distinct CD8+ T cell populations, suggesting different roles in regulating the antitumor response. Engaging LILRB1 with its ligand HLA-G on tumor cells significantly inhibited BiTE molecule-induced CD8+ T cell activation. Blockades of LILRB1 and PD1 induced greater CD8+ T cell activation than either treatment alone. Together, our data suggest that LILRB1 functions as a negative regulator of human CD8+ effector T cells and that blocking LILRB1 represents a unique strategy to enhance BiTE molecule therapeutic activity against solid tumors.',\n",

Although primary cSCCs can be successfully treated with surgery, a subset of highly aggressive lesions may progress to advanced disease, representing a public health care problem with significant cancer-related morbidity and mortality. A complex network of genes (TP53, CDKN2A, NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, EGFR and TERT) and molecular pathways (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR) have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cSCC. The epigenetic regulation of TP53 and CDKN2A is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of cSCC, as well as NOTCH activating agents capable to restore its tumour-suppressor function.

These CD8+ Tfh cells regulate the germinal center B cell response and control autoantibody production, as deficiency of Stat5 in CD8 T cells leads to an increase of CD8+ Tfh cells, resulting in the breakdown of B cell tolerance and concomitant autoantibody production.

       " 'Purpose: The recent success of anti-PD1 antibody in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with microsatellite instability (MSI), known to be associated with an upregulated Th1/Tc1 gene signature, provides new promising therapeutic strategies. However, the partial objective response highlights a crucial need for relevant, easily evaluable, predictive biomarkers. Here we explore whether in situ assessment of Tbet+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) reflects a pre-existing functional antitumor Th1/Tc1/IFNγ response, in relation with clinicopathological features, microsatellite status and expression of immunoregulatory molecules (PD1, PDL1, IDO-1). Methodology: In two independent cohorts of CRC (retrospective n =\\xa080; prospective n =\\xa027) we assessed TILs density (CD3, Tbet, PD1) and expression profile of PDL1 and IDO-1 by immunohistochemistry/image analysis. Furthermore, the prospective cohort allowed to perform ex vivo CRC explant cultures and measure by Elisa the IFNγ response, at baseline and upon anti-PD1 treatment. Results: The density of Tbet+ TILs was significantly higher in MSI CRC, especially in the medullary subtype but also in a subgroup of MSS (microsatellite stable), and positively correlated with PD1 and PDL1 expression, but not with IDO-1. Finally, a high number of Tbet+ TILs was associated with a favorable overall survival. These Tbet+ TILs were functional as their density positively correlated with basal IFNγ levels. In addition, the combined score of Tbet+ PD1+\\xa0TILs coupled with IDO-1 expression predicted the magnitude of the IFNγ response upon anti-PD1. Conclusion: Altogether, immunohistochemical quantification of Tbet+ TILs is a reliable and accurate tool to recapitulate a preexisting Th1/Tc1/IFNγ antitumor response that can be reinvigorated by anti-PD1 treatment.',\n",
       " 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer, and the incidence of HCC is increasing. Recently, cancer immunotherapy has emerged as an efficient treatment against some cancers. Here we have used a mouse model of mutagen-induced HCC to explore the therapeutic usefulness of targeting the DNA-activated STING pathway in HCC. STING-deficient mice exhibited unaltered initial development of HCC, but had higher number of large tumors at late stages of disease. In the liver of STING-deficient HCC mice, we observed reduced levels of phospho-STAT1, autophagy, and cleaved caspase3. These responses were activated in the liver by treatment with a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) STING agonist. Importantly, CDN treatment of mice after HCC development efficiently reduced tumor size. Initiation of CDN treatment at an even later stage of disease to allow HCC detection by MR scanning revealed that the majority of tumors regressed in response to CDN, but new tumors were also detected, which were unresponsive to CDN treatment. Overall, the modulation of the STING pathway affects the development of HCC, and holds promise for a use as a treatment of this disease, most likely in combination with other immunomodulatory treatments such as PD1 inhibitors or with standard of care.',\n",
       " \"'Immune checkpoint blockade' for cancer describes the use of therapeutic antibodies that disrupt negative immune regulatory checkpoints and unleash pre-existing antitumour immune responses. Antibodies targeting the checkpoint molecules cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and PD1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) have had early success in the clinic, which has led to approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of multiple agents in several cancer types. Yet, clinicians still have very limited tools to discriminate a priori patients who will and will not respond to treatment. This has fuelled a wave of research into the molecular mechanisms of tumour-intrinsic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, leading to the rediscovery of biological processes critical to antitumour immunity, namely interferon signalling and antigen presentation. Other efforts have shed light on the immunological implications of canonical cancer signalling pathways, such as WNT-β-catenin signalling, cell cycle regulatory signalling, mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling and pathways activated by loss of the tumour suppressor phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN. Here we review each of these molecular mechanisms of resistance and explore ongoing approaches to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and expand the spectrum of patients who can benefit from immune checkpoint blockade.\",\n",
       " 'Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most popular primary central nervous system cancer and has an extremely expansive course. Aggressive tumor growth correlates with short median overall survival (OS) oscillating between 14 and 17 months. The survival rate of patients in a three-year follow up oscillates around 10%. The interaction of the proteins programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) creates an immunoregulatory axis promoting invasion of glioblastoma multiforme cells in the brain tissue. The PD-1 pathway maintains immunological homeostasis and protects against autoimmunity. PD-L1 expression on glioblastoma surface promotes PD-1 receptor activation in microglia, resulting in the negative regulation of T cell responses. Glioblastoma multiforme cells induce PD-L1 secretion by activation of various receptors such as toll like receptor (TLR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), interferon alpha receptor (IFNAR), interferon-gamma receptor (IFNGR). Binding of the PD-1 ligand to the PD-1 receptor activates the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which dephosphorylates Zap 70, and this inhibits T cell proliferation and downregulates lymphocyte cytotoxic activity. Relevant studies demonstrated that the expression of PD-L1 in glioma correlates with WHO grading and could be considered as a tumor biomarker. Studies in preclinical GBM mouse models confirmed the safety and efficiency of monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis.

This phenomenon, which is well described in patients with malignant melanoma is most frequently described as a size increase of contrast enhancing lesions or appearance of new lesions that stabilize or reduce in size with time. Most other solid tumors have a low incidence of pseudoprogression although cases have been reported for lung, head, and neck cancer and a range of gliomas. Herein we present 6 cases of patients with gastrointestinal cancers who were treated with anti-PD1 (programmed cell death) and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand-1) antibodies, and experience pseudoprogression.',\n",

       " 'The diagnosis of nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) can be challenging, with the differential diagnosis including other low-grade B-cell lymphomas, reactive hyperplasia, and even some cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). PTCL may have a perifollicular growth pattern mimicking NMZL. We and others have noted an atypical distribution of T-follicular helper (TFH) cells in some cases of NMZL. This study was prompted by the diagnosis of NMZL in several cases in which a marked increase of TFH cells, as determined by staining for programmed death-1 (PD1), had prompted suspicion for a diagnosis of PTCL. We analyzed PD1 staining in 48 cases of NMZL to characterize the extent and pattern of the PD1-positive infiltrate. Three main patterns of PD1 staining were identified: follicular pattern (peripheral, n=16; central, n=9; mixed, n=3), diffuse pattern (n=4), and a reduced or normal staining pattern in residual follicles (n=16). A comprehensive analysis of other TFH markers was undertaken in 14 cases with a high content of PD1-positive cells that were confirmed as B-cell lymphoma by clonality analysis. We describe in detail 5 of these cases in which PTCL was an initial consideration. This study illuminates the diverse immunohistochemical patterns encountered in NMZL and highlights a diagnostic pitfall important for diagnostic accuracy.',\n",
       " 'Patients with metastatic HER2 breast cancer (MBC) often become resistant to HER 2 targeted therapy and have recurrence of disease. The Panacea trial suggested that HER2 MBC patients were more likely to respond to checkpoint therapy if TIL were present or if tumor expressed PD-L1. We assessed whether type I polarized dendritic cells (DC1) could improve checkpoint therapy in a preclinical model of HER2+ breast cancer. TUBO bearing mice were vaccinated with either MHC class I or class II HER2 peptide pulsed DC1 (class I or class II HER2-DC1) concurrently or sequentially with administration of anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1. Infiltration of tumors by immune cells, induction of anti-HER2 immunity and response to therapy was evaluated. Class I or class II HER2-DC1 vaccinated mice generated anti-HER2 CD8 or CD4+ T cell immune responses and demonstrated delayed tumor growth. Combining both MHC class I and II HER2-pulsed DC1 did not further result in inhibition of tumor growth or enhanced survival compared to individual administration. Interestingly class II HER2-DC1 led to both increased CD4 and CD8 T cells in the tumor microenvironment while class I peptides typically resulted in only increased CD8 T cells. Anti-PD-1 but not anti-PD-L1 administered sequentially with class I or class II HER2-DC1 vaccine could improve the efficacy of HER2-DC1 vaccine as measured by tumor growth, survival, infiltration of tumors by T cells and increase in systemic anti-HER2 immune responses. Depletion of CD4+ T cells abrogated the anti-tumor efficacy of combination therapy with class II HER2-DC1 and anti-PD-1, suggesting that tumor regression was CD4 dependent. Since class II HER2-DC1 was as effective as class I, we combined class II HER2-DC1 vaccine with anti-rat neu antibodies and anti-PD-1 therapy. Combination therapy demonstrated further delay in tumor growth, and enhanced survival compared to control mice. In summary, Class II HER2-DC1 drives both a CD4 and CD8 T cell tumor infiltration that leads to increased survival, and in combination with anti-HER2 therapy and checkpoint blockade can improve survival in preclinical models of HER2 positive breast cancer and warrants exploration in patients with HER2 MBC.',\n",
       " 'The effect of immunosuppressive drugs on the generation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, specialized in supporting B-cell differentiation, is largely unknown. We examined whether the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (TAC) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) inhibitor sirolimus (SRL) inhibit Tfh cell differentiation, and affect subsequent B-cell functions. Isolated naive T cells were polarized into Tfh-like cells in the presence of TAC or SRL. To demonstrate their functionality, we co-cultured these cells with isolated B cells in the presence of alloantigen and studied the activation and differentiation of these B cells. Tfh-like cells were defined as CD4+CXCR5+ T cells, expressing immunoinhibitory programmed death protein 1 (pd1) and inducible T-cell costimulator (icos). We found that TAC and SRL significantly inhibited Tfh-like cell differentiation. Therapeutic concentrations of TAC and SRL reduced the percentage of pd1+ and icos+ Tfh cells compared to controls. In addition, T cells grown in the presence of TAC or SRL expressed less IL-21 and provided less B-cell help. TAC and SRL both inhibited Tfh-dependent alloantigen-activated B-cell proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells and transitional B cells. In conclusion, TAC and SRL inhibited the differentiation of naive T cells into functional Tfh-like cells, a finding that can be extrapolated to immunosuppressive regimens in transplant patients.',\n",

       " 'The therapeutic scenario for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC has been limited to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Recently, a novel therapeutic approach based on targeting the immune-checkpoints has showed noteworthy results in advanced NSCLC. PD1/PD-L1 pathway is co-opted by tumor cells through the expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface and on cells within the microenvironment, leading to suppression of anti-tumor cytolytic T-cell activity by the tumor. The success of immune-checkpoints inhibitors in clinical trials led to rapid approval by the FDA and EMA. Currently, data regarding efficacy and safety of ICIs in older subjects is limited by the poor number of elderly recruited in clinical trials. Careful assessment and management of comorbidities is essential to achieve better outcomes and limit the immune related adverse events in elderly NSCLC patients.',\n",

       " \"Cytotoxic T cell immunity in response to chronic infections and tumours is maintained by a specialized population of CD8+ T cells that exhibit hallmarks of both exhausted and memory cells and give rise to terminally differentiated exhausted effector cells that contribute to viral or tumour control. Importantly, recent work suggests these cells, which we refer to as 'precursor exhausted' T (TPEX) cells, are responsible for the proliferative burst that generates effector T cells in response to immune checkpoint blockade targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD1), and increased TPEX cell frequencies have recently been linked to increased patient survival. We believe the recent discovery of TPEX cells not only represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain CD8+ T cell responses in chronic infections and tumours but also opens up unexpected avenues for the development of new and innovative therapeutic approaches. In this Opinion article, we discuss the differentiation and function of TPEX cells and suggest that targeting these cells may be key for successful immunotherapy.\",\n",
       " 'The interferons (IFNs) are cytokines with important antineoplastic and immune modulatory effects. These cytokines have been conserved through evolution as important elements of the immune surveillance against cancer. Despite this, defining their precise and specific roles in the generation of antitumor responses remains challenging. Emerging evidence suggests the existence of previously unknown roles for IFNs in the control of the immune response against cancer that may redefine our understanding on how these cytokines function. Beyond the engagement of classical JAK-STAT signaling pathways that promote transcription and expression of gene products, the IFNs engage multiple other signaling cascades to generate products that mediate biological responses and outcomes. There is recent emerging evidence indicating that IFNs control the expression of both traditional immune checkpoints like the PD-L1/PD1 axis, but also less well understood \"intracellular\" immune checkpoints whose targeting may define new approaches for the treatment of malignancies.',\n",
       " 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), although promising, have variable benefit in head and neck cancer (HNC). We noted that tumor galectin-1 (Gal1) levels were inversely correlated with treatment response and survival in patients with HNC who were treated with ICIs. Using multiple HNC mouse models, we show that tumor-secreted Gal1 mediates immune evasion by preventing T cell migration into the tumor. Mechanistically, Gal1 reprograms the tumor endothelium to upregulate cell-surface programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and galectin-9. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that Gal1 blockade increases intratumoral T cell infiltration, leading to a better response to anti-PD1 therapy with or without radiotherapy. Our study reveals the function of Gal1 in transforming the tumor endothelium into an immune-suppressive barrier and that its inhibition synergizes with ICIs.',\n",
       " 'Cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have become increasingly more common in the last two decades, and its incidence has been predicted to climb further. Immunosenescence might explain in part the higher Merkel cell carcinoma prevalence in seniors aged 70 and older. This cancer might also be more aggressive in immunocompromised patients. In a subset of immunocompromised Merkel cell carcinoma patients, we identified significant lymphopenia and a more advanced disease stage compared with their immunocompetent counterparts. Time to death in this cohort was much shorter than in immunocompetent subjects, and their likelihood of death from Merkel cell carcinoma was five times higher. Avelumab approval in 2017 represents an important step forward in the therapy of Merkel cell carcinoma. Hopefully, PD1/PDL1 inhibitors will improve survival in immunocompromised Merkel cell carcinoma hosts, traditionally linked with inferior clinical outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Despite the initial successes of immunotherapy, there is an urgent clinical need for molecular assays that identify patients more likely to respond. Here, we report that ultrasensitive measures of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and T-cell expansion can be used to assess responses to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic lung cancer patients (N = 24). Patients with clinical response to therapy had a complete reduction in ctDNA levels after initiation of therapy, whereas nonresponders had no significant changes or an increase in ctDNA levels. Patients with initial response followed by acquired resistance to therapy had an initial drop followed by recrudescence in ctDNA levels. Patients without a molecular response had shorter progression-free and overall survival compared with molecular responders [5.2 vs. 14.5 and 8.4 vs. 18.7 months; HR 5.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.57-18.35; P = 0.007 and HR 6.91; 95% CI, 1.37-34.97; P = 0.02, respectively], which was detected on average 8.7 weeks earlier and was more predictive of clinical benefit than CT imaging. Expansion of T cells, measured through increases of T-cell receptor productive frequencies, mirrored ctDNA reduction in response to therapy. We validated this approach in an independent cohort of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (N = 14), where the therapeutic effect was measured by pathologic assessment of residual tumor after anti-PD1 therapy. Consistent with our initial findings, early ctDNA dynamics predicted pathologic response to immune checkpoint blockade. These analyses provide an approach for rapid determination of therapeutic outcomes for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and have important implications for the development of personalized immune targeted strategies.Significance: Rapid and sensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA dynamic changes and T-cell expansion can be used to guide immune targeted therapy for patients with lung cancer.See related commentary by Zou and Meyerson, p. 1038.',\n",

       " 'No curative treatment options are available for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Anti-PD1 antibody therapy can induce tumor regression in 20% of advanced HCC patients, demonstrating that co-inhibitory immune checkpoint blockade has therapeutic potential for this type of cancer. However, whether agonistic targeting of co-stimulatory receptors might be able to stimulate anti-tumor immunity in HCC is as yet unknown. We investigated whether agonistic targeting of the co-stimulatory receptor GITR could reinvigorate ex vivo functional responses of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) freshly isolated from resected tumors of HCC patients. In addition, we compared GITR expression between TIL and paired samples of leukocytes isolated from blood and tumor-free liver tissues, and studied the effects of combined GITR and PD1 targeting on ex vivo TIL responses. In all three tissue compartments, CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) showed higher GITR- expression than effector T-cell subsets. The highest expression of GITR was found on CD4+ FoxP3hi CD45RA- activated Treg in tumors. Recombinant GITR-ligand as well as a humanized agonistic anti-GITR antibody enhanced ex vivo proliferative responses of CD4+ and CD8+ TIL to tumor antigens presented by mRNA-transfected autologous B-cell blasts, and also reinforced proliferation, IFN-γ secretion and granzyme B production in stimulations of TIL with CD3/CD28 antibodies. Combining GITR ligation with anti-PD1 antibody nivolumab further enhanced tumor antigen-specific responses of TIL in some, but not all, HCC patients, compared to either single treatment. In conclusion, agonistic targeting of GITR can enhance functionality of HCC TIL, and may therefore be a promising strategy for single or combinatorial immunotherapy in HCC.',\n",

       " 'Background: The programmed death 1 (PD1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) targeted therapies have gained positive outcomes in several tumors, but the evidence of the expression and prognosis value of PD1/PDL1 in high risk prostate cancer was rare. Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis of PDL1/PD1 expression by a validated antibody was performed in a retrospectively collected high risk prostate cancer cohort who received adjuvant hormonal therapy (AHT) after radical prostatectomy (RP). The association between PDL1/PD1 expression and prognosis was determined. Results: In total, 127 patients were enrolled. 49.6% patients were considered PDL1-high expression while the PD1-positive expression proportion was 24.4%. High PDL1 and negative PD1 expression were significantly associated with lower prostate specific antigen (PSA) density (p=0.010 and p=0.033, respectively). Compared with the PDL1-low expression patients, the PDL1-high expression patients had significantly shorter time to PSA nadir (TTN) (P=0.001) and biochemical recurrence (BCR) (P=0.004). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the PDL1-high expression group (p<0.0001) and the PDL1-high/PD1-negative expression group (p<0.0001) showed markedly lower BCR-free survival in localized disease. Univariate cause-specific Cox proportional hazard regression model concluded total PSA (p=0.047), PDL1-high-expression (p<0.001), PDL1-high/PD1-negative expression (p<0.001) were significant risk factors of shorter progression time to BCR in localized disease. PDL1-high-expression was the independent predictor of time to BCR in multiple Cox regression of all patients (Hazard ratio [HR]: 3.901; 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 1.287-11.824; p=0.016). Conclusions: PDL1 expression is not only highly prevalent in high-risk prostate cancer, but is also an independent biomarker in the prognosis of high-risk prostate cancer received AHT after RP. PDL1/PD1 targeted therapy might be a potentially adjuvant treatment option for high-risk prostate cancer after RP.',\n",
       " 'The massive infiltration of lymphocytes into the skin is a hallmark of numerous human skin disorders. By co-culturing murine keratinocytes with splenic T cells we demonstrate here that T cells affect and control the synthesis and secretion of chemokines by keratinocytes. While pre-activated CD8+T cells induce the synthesis of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in keratinocytes and keep in check the synthesis of CXCL1, CXCL5, and CCL20, keratinocytes dampen the synthesis of CCL3 and CCL4 in pre-activated CD8+T cells. One key molecule is IFN-γ that is synthesized by CD8+T cells under the control of NFATc1 and NFATc2. CD8+T cells deficient for both NFAT factors are unable to induce CXCL9 and CXCL10 expression. In addition, CD8+T cells induced numerous type I IFN-inducible \"defense genes\" in keratinocytes encoding the PD1 and CD40 ligands, TNF-α and caspase-1. The enhanced expression of type I IFN-inducible genes resembles the gene expression pattern at the dermal/epidermal interface in lichen planus, an inflammatory T lymphocyte-driven skin disease, in which we detected the expression of CXCL10 in keratinocytes in close vicinity to the infiltration front of T cells. These data reflect the multifaceted interplay of lymphocytes with keratinocytes at the molecular level.',\n",
       " 'Tumor-derived lactic acid inhibits T and natural killer (NK) cell function and, thereby, tumor immunosurveillance. Here, we report that melanoma patients with high expression of glycolysis-related genes show a worse progression free survival upon anti-PD1 treatment. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac lowers lactate secretion of tumor cells and improves anti-PD1-induced T\\xa0cell killing in\\xa0vitro. Surprisingly, diclofenac, but not other NSAIDs, turns out to be a potent inhibitor of the lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 and diminishes lactate efflux. Notably, T\\xa0cell activation, viability, and effector functions are preserved under diclofenac treatment and in a low glucose environment in\\xa0vitro. Diclofenac, but not aspirin, delays tumor growth and improves the efficacy of checkpoint therapy in\\xa0vivo. Moreover, genetic suppression of glycolysis in tumor cells strongly improves checkpoint therapy. These findings support the rationale for targeting glycolysis in patients with high glycolytic tumors together with checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials.',\n",
       " 'Tuberculosis is the most common infectious reason for death and a major cause of pleural effusion globally. To understand the role of chemokines in trafficking of cells during TB pleurisy, we studied the responses to MTB, Ag85A in cells from pleural fluids and peripheral blood. Patients with TB pleural effusions, malignant effusions and asymptomatic healthy controls were enrolled. High expression (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) of IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, IL-8, IFN-γ and IL-23 were observed in pleural fluids of TB patients compared to their plasma where expression of RANTES was significantly higher (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05). On specific stimulation of PFMCs with Ag85A, expression of RANTES was significantly lower in TB compared to NTB patients. We also observed increased expression of T regs and PD1 on CD8+T cells in PFMC of TB patients. Though some of the inflammatory chemokine/cytokines were up-regulated in pleura of TB patients, antigenic stimulation failed to induce them indicating poor antigenic responses at the site. Low expression of RANTES might be a reason for decreased trafficking of cells to the site and dissemination of infection into pleural site. The pattern of RANTES expression in pleural fluid vs serum is interesting. The observations necessitate further studies to investigate the levels of RANTES for its potential biological relevance in TB immunity and its use as a biomarker for diagnosis of pleural TB.',\n",

Immune response has long been a question of great interest in a wide range of fields such as cancer therapies and anti-tumor immunity through checkpoint inhibitors, specifically anti PD-1/ PD-L1 interaction, is a new line of research for treatment of CRC patients. Following the successful development of anti-PD-1 for melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer, several clinical trials have been conducted on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against PD-1 in CRC. There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of anti-PD-1 therapy for MSI (Microsatellite instability) tumors among CRC subtypes. We present a comprehensive knowledge of immune therapy through PD-1/PD-L1 blockade that argues how efficient the process is, in colon cancer carcinoma. In this review, we discuss the responsiveness of immunotherapy on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and various tactics for overcoming weak responses to these checkpoint inhibitors in CRC. More research using controlled trials is required to enable new discoveries to provide continued success with immune-based therapies and grounds for optimism about the future of CRC patients.',\n",

The F8 antibody recognizes the alternatively-spliced ED-A domain of fibronectin, an extracellular matrix component found in most tumor types, while calreticulin has previously been described as an \"eat-me\" signal for dendritic cells and phagocytes. Four fusion proteins, differing in antibody formats and peptide linkers, were produced in mammalian cells, purified to homogeneity and tested in vitro and in vivo. A quantitative biodistribution in F9 tumor-bearing mice revealed that the homobivalent F8-F8-Calr format, featuring a tandem diabody structure, had the best tumor-homing properties and, for this reason, this protein was studied in therapy experiments in CT26 tumor-bearing mice. Intravenous administration of F8-F8-Calr led to a tumor growth retardation, which could be further improved by combination with anti-PD1 antibody treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an increased density of CD8+ T cells, CD11c+ dendritic cells and F4/80+ macrophages in tumor tissue. Even though F8-F8-Calr did not lead to cancer cures at the doses tested, the excellent tolerability profile and the ability to favor a leukocyte infiltration into the neoplastic mass suggests that the targeted delivery of calreticulin may be considered for combination therapy approaches.',\n",

Using this, we uncover that immune checkpoint therapy induces T follicular helper cell activation of B cells to facilitate the anti-tumor response in these models. We also show that B cell activation of T\\xa0cells and the generation of antibody are key to immunotherapy response and propose a new biomarker for immune checkpoint therapy.

       " 'Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is an approved therapy for advanced metastatic mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient cancer regardless of tissue of origin. Although therapy is effective initially, recurrence rates are significant, and long-term outcomes remain poor for most patients. It is not currently recommended to give sequential ICB for advanced MMR-deficient colorectal cancer (CRC) or for patients with metastatic cancer from Lynch syndrome. The need for subsequent therapy options in advanced MMR-deficient cancer beyond the first ICB regimen arises in clinical practice, and there are often no effective standard chemotherapies or other targeted therapies. We report the case of a Lynch syndrome patient with metastatic CRC and urothelial cancer who was treated sequentially with pembrolizumab (targeting PD1), atezolizumab (targeting PD-L1), brief rechallenge with pembrolizumab, and finally the combination of ipilimumab (targeting CTLA-4) and nivolumab (targeting PD1). Over a 28-month period the patient experienced prolonged disease control with each different regimen the first time it was given, including metabolic response by positron emission tomography and computed tomography scanning and tumor marker reductions. The case suggests that some patients with advanced MMR-deficient CRC may experience meaningful clinical benefit from multiple sequential ICB regimens, a strategy that can be further tested in clinical trials. KEY POINTS: The case exemplifies clinical benefit from sequential immune checkpoint blockade in a patient with Lynch syndrome with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer and urothelial cancer.Metabolic response, with decreased fluorodeoxyglucose avidity on positron emission tomography and computed tomography, and reductions in tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, were helpful in this case to monitor disease status over a 28-month period of therapy.The concept of sequential immune checkpoint blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair-deficient cancer merits further study to determine which patients are most likely to benefit.',\n",

Treatment with nivolumab or pembrolizumab in R/M HNSCC patients led to an improved OS with a hazards ratio (HR) of 0.70 (95%CI 0.51-0.96; p\\u2009=\\u20090.01) and HR of 0.80 (95%CI 0.65-0.98, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0161), respectively, as compared to standard of care (SOC) chemo monotherapy regimens (specifically, cetuximab, docetaxel, or methotrexate).

       " 'Recent evidence has confirmed that a mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene occurs early in gliomagenesis and contributes to suppressed immunity. The present study aimed to determine the candidate genes associated with IDH mutation status that could serve as biomarkers of immune suppression for improved prognosis prediction. Clinical information and RNA-seq gene expression data were collected for 932 glioma samples from the CGGA and TCGA databases, and differentially expressed genes in both lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) samples were identified according to IDH mutation status. Only one gene, interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (ISG20), with reduced expression in IDH mutant tumors, demonstrated significant prognostic value. ISG20 expression level significantly increased with increasing tumor grade, and its high expression was associated with a poor clinical outcome. Moreover, increased ISG20 expression was associated with increased infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils, and suppressed adaptive immune response. ISG20 expression was also positively correlated with PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 expression, along with the levels of several chemokines. We conclude that ISG20 is a useful biomarker to identify IDH-mediated immune processes in glioma and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.',\n",

       " 'Chronic inflammation is a key pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis and suggests that resolution of inflammation, orchestrated by specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, is impaired. Here, through targeted-metabololipidomics in peripheral blood of patients with multiple sclerosis, we revealed that each disease form was associated with distinct lipid mediator profiles that significantly correlated with disease severity. In particular, relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis patients were associated with high eicosanoids levels, whereas the majority of pro-resolving lipid mediators were significantly reduced or below limits of detection and correlated with disease progression. Furthermore, we found impaired expression of several pro-resolving lipid mediators biosynthetic enzymes and receptors in blood-derived leukocytes of MS patients. Mechanistically, differentially expressed mediators like LXA4, LXB4, RvD1 and PD1 reduced multiple sclerosis-derived monocyte activation and cytokine production and inhibited inflammation-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction and monocyte transendothelial migration. Altogether, these findings reveal peripheral defects in the resolution pathway in multiple sclerosis, suggesting pro-resolving lipid mediators as novel diagnostic biomarkers and potentially safe therapeutics.',\n",
       " 'Immunotherapy for cancer cells induced by interfering with PD-1/PD-L1 engagement via check-point blockades was initiated by tumour-specific PD-1+ CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) within a tumour mass and eliminate the tumour. Here, we used C57BL/6 (B6) mice implanted with the syngeneic hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6-1, and confirmed that the dendritic cells (DCs) within Hepa1-6-1 tumour mass were tolerogenic with downmodulated co-stimulatory molecules by tumour-derived factors. Although Hepa1-6-1 cells did not prime tumour-specific CTLs within the tumour, specific CTLs primed in the regional lymph nodes seemed to be invaded into the tumour mass. The specific CTLs gained PD-1+ expression when associated with PD-L1+ Hepa1-6-1 cells within the tumour mass. Their cytotoxic activity in vivo was revitalised after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), indicating that PD-1/PD-L1 engagement within the tumour was abrogated by check-point blockade. Nonetheless, the tolerogenic DCs within the Hepa1-6-1 tumour mass remained tolerogenic even after three shots of PD-1-blockade administration, and the suppressed Hepa1-6-1 growth was revisited. In this study, we show here an excellent therapeutic effect consisting of three injections of anti-PD1 mAb and the sequential administration of the CD1d molecule-restricted ligand α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), an immuno-potent lipid/glycolipid, which converts tolerogenic DCs into immunogenic DCs with upregulated expression of co-stimulatory molecules. The α-GalCer-activated DCs secreted a large amount of IL-12, which can activate tumour-specific CTLs in vivo. The check-point blockade was not sufficiently effective, but the dose needed for tumour eradication was reduced by 90% when tumour-bearing mice were also administered i.p. α-GalCer.',\n",

Anti-PD1 antibody (aPD1) immunotherapy is the most significant and impactful therapy for melanoma by immune checkpoint inhibition and T cell stimulation to mediate tumor killing. But the clinical remission rate of aPD1 immunotherapy is limited in melanoma. Here we show a potent combination of aPD1 and photothermal therapy (PTT) by effective delivery of a multifunctional phase-transformation nanocarrier to melanoma tumor. We successfully synthesized multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with aPD1, iron oxide and perfluoropentane (PFP) in lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) shell modified with poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) peptides (GOP@aPD1). In vitro, GOP@aPD1 NPs were characterized for particle size and drug-loading efficiency. The NPs were also tested for photothermal property, optical droplet vaporization (ODV) capacity and the ability of aPD1 release profile. In vivo, GOP@aPD1 NPs were systemically administered to melanoma-bearing mice demonstrated no toxicity and accumulation at tumor site. When mediated with PTT, this synergistic treatment achieved enhanced antitumor efficacy, due to combination of the effective aPD1 release and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor site. In conclusion, GOP@aPD1 NPs combined with PTT could potentiate the efficacy of aPD1 not only by tumor-targeted delivery of aPD1 but also by activating the immune system in the tumor microenvironment, which is a highly effective approach to treat melanoma.',\n",
       " \"T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM3), a member of the TIM family, was originally identified as a receptor expressed on interferon-γ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Initial data indicated that TIM3 functioned as a 'co-inhibitory' or 'checkpoint' receptor, but due to the lack of a definable inhibitory signalling motif, it was also suggested that TIM3 might act as a co-stimulatory receptor. Recent studies have shown that TIM3 is part of a module that contains multiple co-inhibitory receptors (checkpoint receptors), which are co-expressed and co-regulated on dysfunctional or 'exhausted' T cells in chronic viral infections and cancer. Furthermore, co-blockade of TIM3 and programmed cell death 1 (PD1) can result in tumour regression in preclinical models and can improve anticancer T cell responses in patients with advanced cancers. Here, we highlight the developments in understanding TIM3 biology, including novel ligand identification and the discovery of loss-of-function mutations associated with human disease. In addition, we summarize emerging data from human clinical trials showing that TIM3 indeed acts as a 'checkpoint' receptor and that inhibition of TIM3 enhances the antitumour effect of PD1 blockade.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: Immunotherapy has demonstrated durable clinical responses in various cancers by disinhibiting the immune system, largely attributed to the success of immune-checkpoint blockade. However, there are still subsets of patients across multiple cancers not showing robust responses to these agents and one significant barrier to their efficacy may be the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we demonstrated that functional inhibition of MDSCs with (3\\u2009R)-5,6,7-trihydroxy-3-isopropyl-3-methylisochroman-1-one (TIMO), a potent PI3Kδ/γ inhibitor, enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1 antibody in the tumor model.Materials and methods: A syngeneic ovarian tumor model was established. MDSCs from the peripheral blood and tumor parenchyma were analyzed by flow cytometry. Proliferation and killing effects of T-lymphocytes were measured. IFNγ production was measured by ELISA assay. qPCR and western blot were used to detect the gene and protein expression. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of TIMO combined with anti-PD1 antibody were assessed by the tumor model.Results: Our data demonstrated that inhibition of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) function with TIMO could overcome MDSCs-mediated immunosuppression and promote antigen-specific T-lymphocyte responses, resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T cell-mediated tumor control. We further demonstrated that TIMO and anti-PD1 combination therapy promoted tumor growth control in a syngeneic ovarian tumor model.Conclusions: Our results provided proof of concept for a new combination strategy involving the use of a selective inhibitor of PI3Kδ/γ to inhibit the function of MDSCs to enhance tumor responses to immune checkpoint blocking antibodies.',\n",
       " \"Methylation of DNA at CpG sites is the most common and stable of epigenetic changes in cancer. Hypermethylation acts to limit immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by inhibiting endogenous interferon responses needed for recognition of cancer cells. By contrast, global hypomethylation results in the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and inhibitory cytokines, accompanied by epithelial-mesenchymal changes that can contribute to immunosuppression. The drivers of these contrasting methylation states are not well understood. DNA methylation also plays a key role in cytotoxic T cell 'exhaustion' associated with tumor progression. We present an updated exploratory analysis of how DNA methylation may define patient subgroups and can be targeted to develop tailored treatment combinations to help improve patient outcomes.\",\n",
       " 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a new class of monoclonal antibodies that amplify T-cell-mediated immune responses against cancer cells. The introduction of these new drugs, first anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4) and then anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD1), was a major improvement in the treatment of advanced or metastatic melanoma, a highly immunogenic tumour. The development strategy for immune checkpoint immunotherapies differed from that traditionally used for cytotoxic therapies in oncology. The choices of doses at which to conduct clinical trials, and subsequently the choice of doses at which to use these new therapies, were not based on the identification of a maximum tolerated dose from dose-escalation studies; thus, pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling was essential. The studies conducted have shown that the pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab were linear and not time-dependent. In addition, there was a correlation between the trough concentrations of ipilimumab and its therapeutic efficacy. On the contrary, the anti-PD1 immunotherapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab had time-dependent pharmacokinetics. Their therapeutic efficacy was not related to their trough concentration, but there was a correlation between the clearance of anti-PD1 and the survival of melanoma patients. This review highlights the complexity of interpreting the exposure-response relationships of these agents. Further studies are needed to assess the value of therapeutic drug monitoring of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma.',\n",
       " 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is swiftly increasing in prevalence globally with a high mortality rate. The progression of HCC in patients is induced with advanced fibrosis, mainly cirrhosis, and hepatitis. The absence of proper preventive or curative treatment methods encouraged extensive research against HCC to develop new therapeutic strategies. The Food and Drug Administration-approved Nexavar (sorafenib) is used in the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC. In 2017, Stivarga (regorafenib) and Opdivo (nivolumab) got approved for patients with HCC after being treated with sorafenib, and in 2018, Lenvima (lenvatinib) got approved for patients with unresectable HCC. But, owing to the rapid drug resistance development and toxicities, these treatment options are not completely satisfactory. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new systemic combination therapies that target different signaling mechanisms, thereby decreasing the prospect of cancer cells developing resistance to treatment. In this review, HCC etiology and new therapeutic strategies that include currently approved drugs and other potential candidates of HCC such as Milciclib, palbociclib, galunisertib, ipafricept, and ramucirumab are evaluated.',\n",

       " 'Older age is associated with increased infectious morbidity and decreased immune responses to vaccines, but the mechanisms that mediate this effect are incompletely understood. The efficacy and immunogenicity of the live attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL) have a very-well-described negative association with the age of the vaccinee. In a study of 600 ZVL recipients 50 to >80\\u2009years of age, we investigated immunological factors that might explain the effect of age on the immunogenicity of ZVL. Using FluoroSpot assays and flow cytometry, we determined that varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific peak T helper 1 (VZV-Th1) responses to ZVL were independently predicted by prevaccination VZV-Th1 responses, regulatory T cells (Treg), and PD1-expressing immune checkpoint T cells (Tcheck) but not by the age of the vaccinee. Persistence of VZV-Th1 1\\u2009year after vaccination was independently predicted by the factors mentioned above, by peak VZV-Th1 responses to ZVL, and by the age of the vaccinee. We further demonstrated by ex vivo blocking experiments the mechanistic role of PD1 and CTLA4 as modulators of decreased VZV-Th1 responses in the study participants. VZV-specific cytotoxic T cell (VZV-CTL) and T follicular helper responses to ZVL did not correlate with age, but similar to other Th1 responses, VZV-CTL peak and baseline responses were independently correlated. These data expand our understanding of the factors affecting the magnitude and kinetics of T cell responses to ZVL in older adults and show the importance of prevaccination Treg and Tcheck in modulating the immunogenicity of ZVL. This presents new potential interventions to increase vaccine responses in older adults.IMPORTANCE Vaccination is the most effective method to protect older adults against viral infections. However, the immunogenicity of viral vaccines in older adults is notoriously poor. The live attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL) provides the best example of a gradual decrease of vaccine immunogenicity with every 10-year age increase above 50\\u2009years. Here we show that the abundance of regulatory T cells before vaccine administration to older adults has a significant inhibitory effect on immune responses to ZVL and, together with baseline immunity to varicella-zoster virus, explains the effect of age on the immunogenicity of ZVL. Moreover, in vitro blockade of regulatory T cell mechanisms of action with biologic modulators restores immune responses to varicella-zoster virus in vaccinees. Collectively, these observations suggest that immune modulators that block regulatory T cell activity may increase responses to viral attenuated vaccines in older adults.',\n",
       " \"Tumor cells can escape immune surveillance through the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis suppressing T cells. However, we recently demonstrated that high-affinity variants of soluble human programmed death-ligand 1 (shPD-L1) could diminish the suppression. We propose that in comparison to the wild-type shPD-L1, the further affinity enhancement will confer the molecule with opposite characteristics that augment T-cell activation and immunotherapeutic drug potential. In this study, a new shPD-L1 variant, L3C7c, has been generated to demonstrate ∼167 fold greater affinity than wild-type hPD-L1. The L3C7c-Fc fusion protein demonstrated completely opposite effects of conventional PD-1 axis by promoting redirected T-cell proliferation, activation and cytotoxicity in vitro, as being slightly better than that of anti-PD1-Ab (Pembrolizumab). Moreover, L3C7c-Fc was more effective than Pembrolizumab in enhancing redirected T cells' ability to suppress Mel624 melanoma growth in vivo. As a downsized L3C7c-Fc variant, L3C7v-Fc improved the anti-tumor efficacy in vivo when combined with dendritic cell vaccines. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that high-affinity hPD-L1 variants could be developed as the next generation reagents for tumor immunotherapy based on the blockade of the PD-1 axis.\",\n",
       " 'The changes that occur in the immune system with aging are commonly termed immunosenescence. Immunosenescence affects almost all components and functions of the immune response. The most commonly described change is a decrease in numbers and proportions of naïve T cells combined with the increase of terminally differentiated T lymphocytes, mainly affecting CD8+ T cells. The changes in the naïve T cell compartment are principally attributed to thymic involution and lifelong chronic antigen stimulation, among other triggers. Several strategies such as hormonal products, thymic peptides, or cytokines have been proposed for the restoration of the immune system. Here we show the effects of Biomodulina T (BT) on several populations of the immune system when administered to elderly patients diagnosed with recurrent respiratory infections. BT is a polypeptide fraction of bovine thymus, a Cuban product that obtained sanitary registration in 1994 for its immunomodulatory effects. We found that CD4+ naïve T, CD8+ stem cell-like memory (SCM) T, CD4+ recent thymic emigrants (RTE) T and CD4+ CD31+ naïve T cells increased with the administration of BT, whereas CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing PD1 decreased after the treatment with BT. Additionally, the proliferative capacity of CD4+ T cells measured by Ki67 expression, and the CD4+ T cell ability to produce IFN-γ were also improved by BT. Moreover, BT did not increase CD4+ Tregs. Altogether, these findings suggest that BT administration is a promising strategy for immune restoration in elderly patients and improvement of immunotherapeutic potential in cancer patients.',\n",

Here, we describe a sensitive method for the enumeration and isolation of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T\\xa0cells from small samples of patient tumor or blood. The method relies on magnetic nanoparticles that present neoantigen-loaded major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramers at high avidity by barcoded DNA linkers. The magnetic particles provide a convenient handle to isolate the desired cell populations, and the barcoded DNA enables multiplexed analysis. The method exhibits superior recovery of antigen-specific T\\xa0cell populations relative to literature approaches. We applied the method to profile neoantigen-specific T\\xa0cell populations in the tumor and blood of patients with metastatic melanoma over the course of anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

       " 'Anti-PD1 immunotherapies have become an essential treatment for bronchial cancer. According to published studies, PD1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have a better toxicity profile than chemotherapy. Nevertheless, some immune related toxicities can be potentially severe, such as induced interstitial lung disease (ILD). Currently, ILD patients are excluded from clinical trials using immunotherapy in lung cancer. IPF is the most frequent and severe form of ILD. Lung cancer represents a major complication of this disease and to date few data exist on the safety of immunotherapy in this context. We report 3 cases of IPF with lung cancer treated by nivolumab. All had a clinically mild to moderate IPF. The patients had received at least one line of chemotherapy before nivolumab and had progressive, metastatic lung cancer. Two patients experienced rapid cancer progression without immune toxicities. The third had a partial response but developed grade III immune colitis that led to discontinuation of the treatment. None developed lung toxicity or worsening of IPF on CT during follow-up, and death was always related to progression of the cancer. In our series of three patients with IPF, nivolumab was well tolerated with regard to their pulmonary condition. As inflammation and autoimmunity are probably marginal mechanisms in the pathogenesis of IPF, we do not believe that the presence of IPF should definitely disqualify potential candidates for treatment with nivolumab. Decisions should be taken, case-by-case, in selected patients without severe IPF and with no evidence of autoimmunity. In view of the epidemiology of lung cancer in IPF and the critical role of immunotherapy in the management of lung cancer, studies of prospective cohorts are urgently needed in this population.',\n",
       " 'Infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T cells have been shown to worsen inflammatory liver damage in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Inhibitory T cell receptors such as the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and the natural killer cell receptor 2B4 regulate the activity of CD4 and CD8 T cells and therefore play an important role in immune tolerance required in the liver. In this study, we investigated the expression profile of inhibitory T cell receptors on CD4 and CD8 T cells in a mouse model of NASH. Male B57BL/6J mice were fed a Western diet for 24 weeks. The expression levels of inhibitory receptors on the surface of intrahepatic and peripheral T cells were measured and correlated with markers of activation (CD107a, CD69, and CD44), metabolic disorder (serum triglycerides, serum cholesterol, γ-glutamyl transferase, hepatic triglycerides), inflammation (serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) and hepatic fibrosis (collagen 1A1, α-smooth muscle actin, hydroxyproline). Under Western diet, PD1 is exclusively upregulated on intrahepatic and peripheral CD8+ T cells, whereas the expression level on CD4 T cells is unaffected. In contrast, 2B4 is upregulated liver-specifically on both CD4 and CD8 T cells and unchanged on peripheral T cells. Upregulation of PD1 on CD8 T cells is restricted to CD8 effector memory T cells and correlates with lower levels of degranulation. Similarly, the inhibitory function of PD1 on intrahepatic CD4 T cells is shown by a lower CD69 and CD44 expression on PD1-positive CD4 T cells. In murine steatohepatitis, the upregulation of PD1 on CD8 T cells and 2B4 on CD4 and CD8 T cells potentially limits T cell-mediated liver damage. Therefore, these inhibitory T cell receptors could serve as promising targets of immune-modulatory NASH therapy.',\n",

Although molecular studies point to qualitative and quantitative deregulation of immune checkpoints, in depth cellular analysis of FL immune escape is lacking. Here, by functional assays and in silico analyses we show that a subset of FL patients displays a 'high' immune escape phenotype. These FL cases are characterized by abundant infiltration of PD1+ CD16+ TCRVγ9Vδ2 γδ T lymphocytes. In a 3D co-culture assay (MALC), γδ T cells mediate both direct and indirect (ADCC in the presence of anti-CD20 mAbs) cytolytic activity against FL cell aggregates. Importantly, PD-1, which is expressed by most FL-infiltrating γδ T lymphocytes with ADCC capacity, impairs these functions. In conclusion, we identify a PD1-regulated γδ T cell cytolytic immune component in FL. Our data provide a treatment rational by PD-1 blockade aimed at boosting γδ T cell anti-tumor functions in FL.\",\n",

However, these treatments are limited in efficacy and safety for patients with large tumor sizes. Here, we report a case series of combined SBRT and anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with unresectable HCC of large tumors. Methods: This is a retrospective case series of five patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated with SBRT followed by anti-PD1 antibodies. Four patients (80%) received a single dose of TACE prior to SBRT. All patients had advanced HCC ineligible of curative intervention. In this study, we report their treatment responses according to modified RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumor) criteria, 1-year local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), 1-year overall survival (OS) rate, and toxicities. Results: Among the five evaluated patients, three patients had underlying diseases of hepatitis B and four patients had Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage C. The median size of their tumors was 9.8 cm (range: 9-16.1 cm). In addition, two patients had tumor vascular thrombosis and one had extra-hepatic disease. Five out of five patients (100%) responded to treatment, with two complete responses (CR) and three partial responses (PR). Among the partial responders, one had a down-staged tumor that became amenable for radiofrequency ablation for tumor clearance. No patient developed tumor progression at the time of analysis during the median follow-up of 14.9 months (range 8.6-19 months). The median PFS was 14.9 months (range: 8.6-19 months); 1-year LC and OS rate were both 100%. One patient had grade ≥ 3 toxicities (pneumonitis and skin reaction).

Tumor microenvironment (TME) immune phenotypes play crucial roles in predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic efficacy. Method: In this study, we depict the immune landscape of IDC by using transcriptome profiling and clinical characteristics retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Immune cell infiltration was evaluated via single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) analysis and systematically correlated with genomic characteristics and clinicopathological features of IDC patients. Furthermore, an immune signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm. A random forest algorithm was applied to identify the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed immune signature. A nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the immune signature to predict survival probability was constructed by multivariate Cox regression. Results: The IDC were clustered into low immune infiltration, intermediate immune infiltration, and high immune infiltration by the immune landscape. The high infiltration group had a favorable survival probability compared with that of the low infiltration group. The low-risk score subtype identified by the immune signature was characterized by T cell-mediated immune activation. Additionally, activation of the interferon-α response, interferon-γ response, and TNF-α signaling via the NFκB pathway was observed in the low-risk score subtype, which indicated T cell activation and may be responsible for significantly favorable outcomes in IDC patients. A random forest algorithm identified the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed immune signature. Furthermore, a nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the immune signature to predict survival probability was constructed, revealing that the immune signature was an independent prognostic biomarker. Finally, the relationship of VEGFA, PD1, PDL-1, and CTLA-4 expression with the immune infiltration landscape and the immune signature was analyzed to interpret the responses of IDC patients to immunotherapy. Conclusion: Taken together, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the immune landscape of IDC and constructed an immune signature related to the immune landscape. This analysis of TME immune infiltration landscape has shed light on how IDC respond to immunotherapy and may guide the development of novel drug combination strategies.',\n",

The target lesion control rate at 1-year was significantly higher in the ICI+RT group than in the RT-alone group or ICI-alone group (94.1% vs. 57.1% vs. 25%; P < 0.05). No abscopal effect was observed in our cohort. Treatment-related AEs were not significantly increased in the combined treatment group compared with the RT-alone group (P > 0.05). No grade ≥3 AEs occurred in the ICI+RT group. Conclusions: Besides RT acting as an immune adjuvant, ICI might have a radiosensitizing effect and may increase LC without severe toxicity. We have initiated a phase II study to determine the effects of RT in patients with melanoma undergoing anti-PD1 (NCT04017897).',\n",
       " \"Therapy of children with post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) after hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) and solid organ transplantation (SOT) can be challenging. In this retrospective study, we investigated PD-L1 and PD1 expression in all PTLD categories of childhood and adolescence to see whether checkpoint inhibition with PD-L1/PD1 inhibitors may serve as a therapy option. We included 21 patients aged 19\\xa0years or younger (at date of transplant) with PTLD following SOT or HSCT having adequate tumor samples available (n\\xa0=\\xa029). Using immunohistochemistry, we evaluated PD-L1/PD1 expression on both tumor cells and cells of the microenvironment in all samples. Availability of consecutively matched tumor samples during 6 of 21 patients' disease courses also allowed an intra-individual assessment of PD-L1/PD1 expression. We observed lower PD-L1 and higher PD1 expression in non-destructive lesions, and higher PD-L1 and lower PD1 expression in polymorphic and, in particular, in monomorphic PTLD, mostly diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL, n\\xa0=\\xa010/21). The amount of PD-L1- and PD1-positive cells changed in the opposite way in sequential biopsies of the same individual correlating well with the PTLD category. This is the first comprehensive pediatric study assessing PD-L1 and PD1 expression on tumor cells and in the microenvironment of PTLD including not only monomorphic, but also non-destructive early lesions. PD-L1 expression of the tumor cells inversely correlated with PD1 expression in surrounding tissues, with the highest expression in DLBCL. Since PTLD can be therapeutically challenging, our results indicate a potential efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors if standard immune- and/or chemotherapy fail or are impossible. We therefore recommend routine staining of PD-L1 and PD1 in all PTLD categories.\",\n",

High tumor mutational burden because of microsatellite instability (MSI) seems to be a predictor of response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in different tumors. Therefor in 2017 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permitted the therapy of solid tumors with proven Microsatellite instability (MSI) with PD1 antibody Pembrolizumab independently of their origin.

       " 'Disrupting the binding of CD47 to SIRPα has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for advanced cancers by potentiating antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of targeted antibodies. Pre-clinically, CD47/SIRPα blockade induces antitumor activity by increasing the phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages and enhancing the cross-presentation of tumor antigens to CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells; both of these processes are potentiated by CD40 signaling. Here we generated a novel, two-sided fusion protein incorporating the extra cellular domains of SIRPα and CD40L, adjoined by a central Fc domain, termed SIRPα-Fc-CD40L. SIRPα-Fc-CD40L bound CD47 and CD40 with high affinity and activated CD40 signaling in the absence of Fc receptor cross-linking. No evidence of hemolysis, hemagglutination or thrombocytopenia was observed in vitro or in cynomolgus macaques. Murine SIRPα-Fc-CD40L outperformed CD47 blocking and CD40 agonist antibodies in murine CT26 tumor models and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade of PD1 and CTLA4. SIRPα-Fc-CD40L activated a type I interferon response in macrophages and potentiated the activity of ADCP-competent targeted antibodies both in vitro and in vivo. These data illustrated that whereas CD47/SIRPα inhibition could potentiate tumor cell phagocytosis, CD40-mediated activation of a type I interferon response provided a bridge between macrophage and T cell mediated immunity that significantly enhanced durable tumor control and rejection.',\n",
       " 'Thymomas, as well as thymic carcinomas, are extremely rare tumors that arise from the thymus. The management of these tumors is primarily the complete surgical resection, however when there is tumor progression or metastatic unresectable disease, palliative platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care. On this setting, alternative options are emerging including immune checkpoints inhibitors. Based on that, PDL-1 expression was measured in thymic tumors as a potential predictive biomarker of response to anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 immune inhibitors. Our objective is to report the first two cases of fatal toxicity due to anti- PD1 therapy in thymoma patients.',\n",
       " 'Therapies to inhibit programmed cell death 1 and its ligand (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) provide significant survival benefits in many cancers, but the efficacy of these treatments varies considerably across different cancer types. Identifying the underlying variables associated with this cancer type-specific response remains an important open research challenge.',\n",
       " \"Monoclonal anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) antibodies are successful cancer therapeutics, but it is not well understood why individual antibodies should have idiosyncratic side-effects. As the humanized antibody SHR-1210 causes capillary hemangioma in patients, a unique toxicity amongst anti-PD1 antibodies, we performed human receptor proteome screening to identify nonspecific interactions that might drive angiogenesis. This screen identified that SHR-1210 mediated aberrant, but highly selective, low affinity binding to human receptors such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), frizzled class receptor 5 and UL16 binding protein 2 (ULBP2). SHR-1210 was found to be a potent agonist of human VEGFR2, which may thereby drive hemangioma development via vascular endothelial cell activation. The v-domains of SHR-1210's progenitor murine monoclonal antibody 'Mab005' also exhibited off-target binding and agonism of VEGFR2, proving that the polyspecificity was mediated by the original mouse complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), and had survived the humanization process. Molecular remodelling of SHR-1210 by combinatorial CDR mutagenesis led to deimmunization, normalization of binding affinity to human and cynomolgus PD1, and increased potency in PD1/PD-L1 blockade. Importantly, CDR optimization also ablated all off-target binding, rendering the resulting antibodies fully PD1-specific. As the majority of changes to the paratope were found in the light chain CDRs, the germlining of this domain drove the ablation of off-target binding. The combination of receptor proteome screening and optimization of the antibody binding interface therefore succeeded in generating novel, higher-potency, specificity-enhanced therapeutic IgGs from a single, clinically sub-optimal progenitor. This study showed that highly-specific off-target binding events might be an under-appreciated phenomenon in therapeutic antibody development, but that these unwanted properties can be fully ameliorated by paratope refinement.\",\n",
       " 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has greatly improved treatment of various advanced cancers but increasing use of ICI therapy has exposed the risk of ICI-related cardiovascular side effects. Immune checkpoints are inhibitory regulators of T cell activation and mediate T cell effector functions during physiological responses to shield from autoimmune reactions. ICI therapy for advanced cancers promotes immune activity against tumors and is applied within a broad collective of cancer patients. Widespread use of ICI therapy has revealed the burden of immune related adverse events with various organ manifestations and characteristics. Since immune checkpoints are highly relevant for maintaining myocardial homeostasis as emerging evidence implicates, inhibition of immune checkpoint pathways has been associated with various forms of cardiotoxicity in preclinical models and patients. Although ICI-related cardiotoxicity is rare, it has significant relevance due to high mortality rates. This review focuses on current knowledge about cardiac ICI-related toxicity. We summarize the most common forms and delineate incidence, presentation, and treatment. Clinical characteristics are correlated to potential underlying pathomechanisms. We outline epidemiology, risk factors, and course of disease. Recommendations for monitoring and critical diagnostic measures are specified within the context of different forms of cardiac involvement. Different therapeutic implications for suspected ICI-related cardiotoxicity and their limitations are critically summarized. We highlight current gaps of knowledge concerning the underlying pathomechanisms and clinical characteristics of ICI-related cardiotoxicity. Future challenges are depicted for optimum cardio-oncology care of patients receiving ICI therapy.',\n",
       " 'Immune-targeted therapies that activate effector lymphocytes such as Natural Killer (NK) cells are currently being investigated for the treatment of Multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common form of hematological cancer. However, individual NK cells are highly heterogeneous in their cytolytic potential, making it difficult to detect, quantify and correlate the outcome of dynamic effector-target cell interactions at single cell resolution. Here, we present a microfluidic bioassay platform capable of activity-based screening of cellular and molecular immunotherapies. We identified distinct functional signatures associated with NK-MM cell interaction. The addition of immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide altered responses of NK-susceptible MM cells but not that of NK-tolerant MM cells. Antitumor cytotoxicity was significantly increased by the blockade of PD1/PDL1 axis as well as the clinically relevant cell line NK92, which were used to construct molecular logic functions (AND and NOT gates). A predictive agent-based mathematical model was developed to simulate progressive disease states and drug efficacy. The findings of the current study validate the applicability of this microfluidic cytotoxicity assay for immunotherapy screening, biocomputation and for future employment in detection of patient-specific cell response for precision medicine.',\n",
       " \"Immunotherapy (IO) with anti-PD1 inhibitors is available for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHD) since 2016. Both nivolumab and pembrolizumab were tested in phase 3 randomized trials in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy and were found to confer an overall survival benefit compared to investigator's choice. However, very limited data exist concerning IO use in rare subtypes of head and neck carcinoma, like salivary gland carcinoma. We retrospectively collected clinical data of all patients diagnosed with rare subtypes of head and neck carcinoma, who were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in our department during the last 5\\u202fyears. We analyzed safety and efficacy of these therapies. We identified six patients who received nivolumab for recurrent or metastatic head and neck carcinomas, between 31 and 57\\u202fyears old. All patients had received at least one line of platinum-chemotherapy, as well as radiation therapy. Treatment was administered every 2\\u202fweeks, at a dose of 3\\u202fmg per kilogram of body weight. Number of nivolumab cycles varied between 2 and 18. Progression-free survival varied from 1 to 12\\u202fmonths and overall survival from 4 to 24\\u202fmonths. Tolerance was very good, except for one case of diabetes and hypothyroidism requiring medication. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding the optimal treatment of the rare non-squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Our case series supports a role for immunotherapy in these patients. However, larger collaborative studies are needed to evaluate this treatment.\",\n",
       " 'Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lysophospholipid generated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), regulates lymphocyte egress into circulation via S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling, and it controls the differentiation of regulatory T\\xa0cells (Tregs) and T helper-17 cells. However, the mechanisms by which receptor-independent SphK1-mediated intracellular S1P levels modulate T\\xa0cell functionality remains unknown. We show here that SphK1-deficient T\\xa0cells maintain central memory phenotype and exhibit higher mitochondrial respiration and reduced differentiation to Tregs. Mechanistically, we discovered a direct correlation between SphK1-generated S1P and lipid transcription factor PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) activity, which in turn regulates lipolysis in T\\xa0cells. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of SphK1 improved metabolic fitness and anti-tumor activity of T\\xa0cells against murine melanoma. Further, inhibition of SphK1 and PD1 together led to improved control of\\xa0melanoma.

       " 'Nanomedicine development aims to enhance the efficacy, accuracy, safety, and/or compliance of diagnosis and treatment of diseases by leveraging the unique properties of engineered nanomaterials. To this end, a multitude of organic and inorganic nanoparticles have been designed to facilitate drug delivery, sensing, and imaging, some of which are currently in clinical trials or have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the process, the increasing knowledge in understanding how natural particulates, including cells, pathogens, and organelles, interact with body and cellular systems has spurred efforts to mimic their morphology and functions for developing new generations of nanomedicine formulations. In addition, the advances in bioengineering tools, bioconjugation chemistries, and bio-nanotechnologies have further enabled researchers to exploit these natural particulates for theranostic purposes. In this Account, we will discuss the recent progress in our lab on engineering bioinspired and biomimetic synthetic and cellular systems toward rational design of nanomedicine platforms for treating diabetes and cancer. Inspired by the structure and response mechanism of pancreatic β-cells, we synthesized a series of insulin granule-like vesicles that can respond to high blood or intestinal glucose levels for aiding in transdermal or oral insulin delivery, respectively. Then, to more closely mimic the multicompartmental architecture of β-cells, we further developed synthetic artificial cells with vesicle-in-vesicle superstructures which can sense blood glucose levels and dynamically release insulin via a membrane fusion process. Meanwhile, clues drawn from the traits of anaerobic bacteria that selectively invade and proliferate in solid tumors inspired the synthesis of a light-tuned hypoxia-responsive nanovesicle for implementing synergistic cancer therapy. In parallel, we also studied how autologous particulates could be recruited for developing advanced drug delivery systems. Through combination of genetic engineering and top-down cell engineering technologies, biomimetic nanomedicines derived from cytoplasmic membrane with programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptors expressed on surfaces were generated and employed for cancer immunotherapy. Based on our earlier study where aPD-L1 (antibodies against PD ligand 1)-conjugated platelets could release aPD-L1-bearing particles in situ and inhibit postsurgical tumor recurrence, we further genetically engineered megakaryocytes, the precursor cells of platelets, to express PD-1 receptors. In this way, platelets born with checkpoint blocking activity could be produced directly in vitro, avoiding post chemical modification processes while exerting similar therapeutic impact. As a further extension, by virtue of the bone marrow-homing ability of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we recently conceived a cell-combination strategy by conjugating HSCs with platelets decorated with antibodies against PD1 (aPD-1) to suppress the growth and recurrence of leukemia. While we are still on the way of digging deep to understand and optimize bioinspired and biomimetic drug carriers, we expect that the strategies summarized in this Account would contribute to the development of advanced nanomedicines.',\n",
       " 'BRAF and CRAF are critical components of the MAPK signaling pathway which is activated in many cancer types. In approximately 1% of melanomas, BRAF or CRAF are activated through structural arrangements. We describe here a metastatic melanoma with a GOLGA4-RAF1 fusion and pathogenic variants in CTNNB1 and CDKN2A. Anti-CTLA4/anti-PD1 combination immunotherapy failed to control tumor progression. In the absence of other actionable variants the patient was administered MEK inhibitor therapy on the basis of its potential action against RAF1 fusions. This resulted in a profound and clinically significant response. We demonstrated that GOLGA4-RAF1 expression was associated with ERK activation, elevated expression of the RAS/RAF downstream co-effector ETV5, and a high Ki67 index. These findings provide a rationale for the dramatic response to targeted therapy. This study shows that thorough molecular characterization of treatment-resistant cancers can identify therapeutic targets and personalize management, leading to improved patient outcomes.',\n",
       " 'The elimination of residual microscopic cancer cells is important cancer treatment. The immunoediting theory describes the balance between the immune system and cancer cells. The current study investigated changes in the immune system during the elimination of cancer cells and evaluated the influence of cluster of differentiation (CD)4 or CD8 depletion. A human squamous cell cancer cell line (SNU1041) was injected in the lateral tongue of immunocompetent mice and the changes in the CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD19, CD40 and CD40 ligand (L) populations in the blood, lymph nodes and spleen were evaluated using flow cytometry, and changes in serum cytokine levels were evaluated using a magnetic bead panel. Cancer cell elimination was delayed by CD4 depletion but not by CD8 depletion. The CD8-depleted group indicated increased levels of CD40L, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. It was concluded that CD4 served a crucial role in the elimination of human cancer cells. Furthermore, the efficacies of CD40 agonist and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) antagonist treatments were assessed in CD4-depleted mice. CD40 agonist treatment resulted in faster cancer cell elimination and increased cytokine excretion. In conclusion, CD4 or CD40L significantly influenced cancer elimination. CD40 agonist antibodies may be potent adjuvant agents that can be used in patients with reduced CD4 or CD40L expression.',\n",
       " 'Constructing solid-solution-alloy electrocatalysts with tunable surface electronic configurations is the key to optimize intermediate bindings and thereby to promote the activity and selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, Pd1-xAgx alloy electrocatalysts are investigated as a platform to uncover the electronic effects on the CO2RR. The optimal Pd0.75Ag0.25/C affords a superior CO Faradaic efficiency of 95.3% at -0.6 V (vs RHE) in 0.5 M KHCO3, performing at a high level among recently reported electrocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analysis further evidence that varying the composition of Pd1-xAgx alloys can effectively alter the electronic configurations and consequently break the inherent scaling relationship of the binding energy of different intermediates (*COOH and *CO). Among Pd1-xAgx, Pd0.75Ag0.25 gains the obviously weakened *CO and *H bindings but retained well the binding with *COOH, contributing to the facilitated kinetics toward CO product. Elucidating a feasible way to break the scaling relationship and further uncover the underlying mechanism, this work will inspire new design strategies toward active and selective electrocatalysts.',\n",

To further improve overall outcomes, positron emission tomography-driven strategies and ABVD or BEACOPP variants incorporating the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin (BV) or anti-PD1 antibodies are under investigation in advanced-stage patients. The present study aimed to elicit preferences for attributes associated with ABVD, BEACOPPescalated and BV-AVD (BV, adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) among patients and physicians. Cross-sectional online discrete choice experiments were administered to HL patients (n\\xa0=\\xa0381) and haematologists/oncologists (n\\xa0=\\xa0357) in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Included attributes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the risk of neuropathy, lung damage, infertility and hospitalisation due to adverse events. Whereas 5-year PFS and OS were the most important treatment attributes to patients, the relative importance of each attribute and preference weights for each level varied among physicians according to the description of the hypothetical patient for whom treatment was recommended. PFS and OS most strongly influenced physicians' recommendations when considering young female patients who did not want children or young male patients. Infertility was more important to physicians' treatment decision than PFS when considering young women with unknown fertility preferences, whereas hospitalisations due to adverse events played the largest role in treatment decisions for older patients.\",\n",
       " 'Cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing pathways can be triggered to enhance immune response to cancer. In this study, we tested the antitumor activity of a unique RIG-I agonist, stem loop RNA (SLR) 14. In the immunogenic tumor models, we observed significant tumor growth delay and an extended survival in SLR14-treated mice. SLR14 also greatly improved antitumor efficacy of anti-PD1 antibody over single-agent treatment. SLR14 was mainly taken up by CD11b+ myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, and many genes associated with immune defense were significantly up-regulated after treatment, accompanied by increase in the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes, NK cells, and CD11b+ cells in SLR14-treated tumors. Strikingly, SLR14 dramatically inhibited nonimmunogenic B16 tumor growth, and the cured mice developed an immune memory. Furthermore, a systemic antitumor response was observed in both bilateral and tumor metastasis models. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SLR14 is a promising therapeutic RIG-I agonist for cancer treatment, either alone or in combination with existing immunotherapies.',\n",

       " 'We explored whether engineering of T cell specificity and effector function improves immunotherapy of solid tumors. Although IL-12 can enhance cancer immunity, a strategy of safe IL-12 delivery without toxicity is currently lacking. We engineered T cells to express IL-12 controlled by the NFAT promoter responsive to TCR stimulation, or by the Tet-On promoter responsive to doxycycline. In vivo, NFAT-engineered T cells caused lethal toxicity, while Tet-engineered T cells were safe in the absence of doxycycline. Combining gene transfer of the melanoma-specific TRP2-TCR with Tet-IL-12 engineering revealed that temporal induction of IL-12 was essential to inhibit the growth of B16F10 melanoma tumors. Induced IL-12 increased the number of tumor-infiltrating T cells and also prevented the down-modulation of the TRP2-TCR and the associated up-regulation of the PD1 marker that was observed in the absence of IL-12. In addition, temporal induction of IL-12 expression also increased the number of plasmacytoid DC in the tumor micro-environment. We show that repeated induction of IL-12 can be used to enhance control of tumor growth without encountering systemic toxicity. The observation that TCR engineering combined with Tet-regulated IL-12 expression can achieve tumor immunity without the side effects that are usually associated with the in vivo use of IL-12 warrants translation of this concept into the clinic.']"
